## Basic Ingredients Table



    Ingredient
    Amount


    Pasta (any variety)
    1 pound


    Cream of mushroom soup
    2 cans


    Mixed vegetables (frozen)
    2 cups


    Cheddar cheese, shredded
    2 cups


    Onion, diced
    1 medium


    Garlic, minced
    3 cloves


    Breadcrumbs
    1 cup


    Butter
    1/4 cup


    Salt and pepper
    To taste





## Instructions


### 1. Preparation (15 minutes)

Begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven heats, gather all your ingredients and prepare your baking dish by greasing it lightly with butter or cooking spray. This prevents sticking and makes cleanup easier.



### 2. Pasta Cooking (12 minutes)

Cook your pasta in a large pot of salted water until it's just shy of al dente. Remember, the pasta will continue cooking in the casserole, so slightly undercooking it now prevents mushiness later.

### 3. Vegetable Preparation (10 minutes)

While the pasta cooks, sauté your diced onions and minced garlic in butter until translucent. Add frozen vegetables and cook until they're just thawed. This step builds a flavor foundation for your casserole.



### 4. Sauce Creation (8 minutes)

In a large bowl, combine cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup of milk, stirring until smooth. Add 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese, keeping the remaining 1/2 cup for topping. Season with salt and pepper to taste.



### 5. Assembly (10 minutes)

Drain your pasta and return it to the pot. Add the vegetable mixture and sauce, stirring gently to combine. For gluten-free variations, check out these [gluten-free soup options](https://healtystack.com/gluten-free-soup-options/).



### 6. Baking (30-35 minutes)

Transfer the mixture to your prepared baking dish. Top with remaining cheese and breadcrumbs. Bake uncovered until bubbling and golden brown on top, approximately 30-35 minutes.



## Recipe Variations

Consider these budget-friendly variations:



    - Tuna Twist: Add two cans of drained tuna

    - Mexican Style: Use salsa instead of cream soup and add black beans

    - Italian Version: Add Italian seasoning and use mozzarella cheese

    - Vegetarian: Add extra vegetables and use vegetable broth



## Storage and Reheating

Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat individual portions in the microwave or larger amounts in the oven at 350°F until heated through.



## Conclusion

Budget-friendly casseroles are more than just economical meals; they're a smart way to create satisfying, nutritious dishes that bring people together. By mastering these basic techniques and understanding the fundamental principles of casserole making, you can create countless variations to suit your taste and budget. Remember, the key to a successful casserole lies in proper preparation and layering of flavors.
