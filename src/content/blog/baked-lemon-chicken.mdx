## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Chicken breasts (boneless, skinless)
    4 pieces (about 6-8 oz each)


    Fresh lemons
    3 medium


    Olive oil
    1/4 cup


    Fresh garlic, minced
    4 cloves


    Fresh rosemary
    2 sprigs


    Fresh thyme
    4 sprigs


    Dijon mustard
    2 tablespoons


    Honey
    1 tablespoon


    Salt
    1 teaspoon


    Black pepper
    1/2 teaspoon


    White wine (dry)
    1/3 cup


    Chicken broth
    1/4 cup





## Instructions


### Preparation Phase


- Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Just as precise temperature control is crucial in recipes like [Slow-Cooked Coffee Beef Roast](https://healtystack.com/slow-cooked-coffee-beef-roast/), getting the right temperature ensures perfectly cooked chicken.


- Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. This step is essential for better browning and marinade absorption.


- Zest two lemons and juice them. Slice the remaining lemon into thin rounds for garnish.


- In a large bowl, combine olive oil, lemon zest, half of the lemon juice, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, honey, salt, and pepper. Whisk until well combined.



### Marinating


- Place chicken breasts in the marinade mixture, ensuring each piece is well-coated.


- Let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or up to 4 hours in the refrigerator for deeper flavor penetration.



### Cooking Process


- Transfer the marinated chicken to a large baking dish, leaving space between each piece.


- Pour the white wine and chicken broth into the bottom of the dish. This creates steam and helps keep the chicken moist during baking.


- Arrange lemon slices, rosemary sprigs, and thyme around and on top of the chicken.


- Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.


- Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) and develops a golden-brown color.


- Remove from the oven and let rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.



### Finishing and Serving


- While the chicken rests, strain the pan juices into a small saucepan.


- Simmer the juices over medium heat until reduced by half, creating a flavorful sauce.


- Drizzle the reduced sauce over the chicken before serving.


- Garnish with fresh herbs and additional lemon slices if desired.



## Conclusion


This Baked Lemon Chicken recipe delivers a perfect balance of citrusy brightness and savory depth. It's a versatile dish that pairs beautifully with various side dishes, from roasted vegetables to grain-based accompaniments like [Kimchi Cauliflower Fried Rice](https://healtystack.com/kimchi-cauliflower-fried-rice/). The combination of fresh herbs, garlic, and lemon creates a dish that's both sophisticated and comforting, making it an excellent choice for any occasion.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I use chicken thighs instead of breasts?

Yes, chicken thighs work wonderfully in this recipe. They typically require an additional 5-10 minutes of cooking time and offer more moisture and flavor. Just ensure they reach the proper internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).



### How long can I store the leftovers?

Properly stored in an airtight container, leftover Baked Lemon Chicken will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Reheat gently in the microwave or oven to maintain moisture.



### Can I make this recipe ahead of time?

You can prepare the marinade and marinate the chicken up to 4 hours in advance. For best results, bring the chicken to room temperature for 30 minutes before baking. The dish is best served fresh from the oven, but leftovers retain their flavor well.
