    Ground cinnamon
    2 teaspoons


    Baking soda
    2 teaspoons


    Salt
    1/2 teaspoon


    Unsalted butter (softened)
    3/4 cup


    Dark brown sugar
    3/4 cup

    Molasses
    1/2 cup

    1 teaspoon





### For the Royal Icing:



    Ingredient
    Amount


    Powdered sugar
    3 cups


    Meringue powder
    2 tablespoons


    Warm water
    5-6 tablespoons


    Food coloring (various colors)
    As needed





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### Preparing the Dough


1. Begin by whisking together the flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. This ensures even distribution of the spices and leavening agents.

2. In a separate large bowl, cream the softened butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. This creates the foundation for tender cookies.

3. Beat in the egg, molasses, and vanilla extract until well combined. The mixture might look slightly curdled, but don't worry – this is normal.

4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Avoid overmixing to prevent tough cookies.

5. Divide the dough into two portions, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. This makes the dough easier to handle and helps maintain cookie shapes during baking.


### Rolling and Cutting


6. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.

7. Working with one portion at a time, roll the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4 inch thickness.

8. Cut out desired shapes using cookie cutters. Similar to making [holiday sugar cookies](https://healtystack.com/easy-christmas-sugar-cookies/), transfer shapes carefully to prepared baking sheets.

9. Gather scraps, re-roll, and cut additional cookies until all dough is used.


### Baking


10. Bake cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are slightly darkened and cookies are firm.

11. Cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.


### Preparing Royal Icing


12. In a large bowl, combine powdered sugar and meringue powder.

13. Gradually add warm water while mixing on low speed. Increase speed to medium-high and beat for 5-7 minutes until stiff peaks form.

14. Divide icing into portions and color as desired with food coloring.


### Decorating Techniques


15. For outlining: Use a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Pipe borders around cookies and let dry for 15-20 minutes.

16. For flooding: Thin some of the royal icing with water until it reaches a honey-like consistency. Fill in outlined areas and use a toothpick to spread to edges.

17. For details: Once base layers are dry, add additional decorative elements like dots, lines, or patterns.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### How long do decorated gingerbread cookies last?


Properly stored in an airtight container at room temperature, decorated gingerbread cookies can last up to two weeks. For best results, keep them away from direct sunlight and humidity.


### Can I make royal icing ahead of time?


Royal icing can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. Cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent crusting, and re-whip before using.
