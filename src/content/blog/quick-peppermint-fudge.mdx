## Ingredients


    
        Ingredient
        Amount
    
    
        Semi-sweet chocolate chips
        3 cups
    
    
        Sweetened condensed milk
        1 (14 oz) can
    
    
        Pure peppermint extract
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Crushed candy canes
        1/2 cup
    
    
        Butter
        2 tablespoons
    
    
        Salt
        1/4 teaspoon
    




## Step-by-Step Instructions


### Preparation

1. Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving overhang on the sides for easy removal. Lightly grease the parchment paper with butter or cooking spray.



2. Crush candy canes by placing them in a sealed plastic bag and using a rolling pin to break them into small pieces. Set aside.



### Making the Fudge Base

3. Create a double boiler by filling a medium saucepan with about 2 inches of water. Place a heat-safe bowl on top, ensuring it doesn't touch the water.



4. Bring the water to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Add chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and butter to the bowl.



5. Stir continuously with a rubber spatula until the chocolate and butter are completely melted and the mixture is smooth and glossy. This typically takes 5-7 minutes.



### Adding Flavoring

6. Remove the bowl from heat and add peppermint extract and salt. Stir thoroughly to combine. Just like when preparing [holiday dishes](https://healtystack.com/stuffed-holiday-squash/), proper seasoning is crucial.



7. Reserve about 2 tablespoons of crushed candy canes for topping, then fold half of the remaining candy pieces into the fudge mixture.



### Setting the Fudge

8. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Tap the pan gently on the counter to remove any air bubbles.



9. Sprinkle the reserved crushed candy canes over the top, pressing them lightly into the surface.



10. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until completely set. For best results, leave it overnight.



### Cutting and Storing

11. Once set, lift the fudge out of the pan using the parchment paper overhangs.



12. Using a sharp knife warmed under hot water and dried, cut the fudge into 1-inch squares. Clean and rewarm the knife between cuts for the cleanest results.



13. Store in an airtight container, separating layers with parchment paper, for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I use white chocolate instead of semi-sweet chocolate?

Yes, white chocolate can be substituted for semi-sweet chocolate. However, reduce the amount of peppermint extract to 1/2 teaspoon as white chocolate has a more delicate flavor that can be easily overpowered.



### Why did my fudge turn out grainy?

Grainy fudge usually results from crystallization during the melting process. To prevent this, ensure you're stirring constantly and melting the chocolate slowly over low heat. Never allow water to come into contact with the chocolate mixture.



### Can this fudge be frozen?

Yes, this fudge freezes well for up to 3 months when properly wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in an airtight container. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before serving.
