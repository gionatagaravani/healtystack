## Ingredients



    Ingredient
    Amount


    Yukon Gold potatoes
    4 pounds


    Unsalted butter
    1 cup (2 sticks)


    Whole milk
    1 cup


    Heavy cream
    1/2 cup


    Salt
    2 teaspoons


    White pepper
    1/2 teaspoon


    Garlic powder (optional)
    1/2 teaspoon





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Potatoes

Start by peeling the potatoes and cutting them into uniform chunks, approximately 1.5 inches in size. Consistency in size ensures even cooking. Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water to prevent browning while you finish preparing all pieces.



### 2. Cooking Process

Transfer the potatoes to a large pot and cover with cold water by about an inch. Add a generous pinch of salt to the water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium-low and simmer for 15-20 minutes. The potatoes are done when you can easily pierce them with a fork.



### 3. Prepare the Dairy

While the potatoes are cooking, warm the milk and cream in a small saucepan over low heat. Cut the butter into small cubes and let it come to room temperature. This step is crucial for achieving smooth, creamy potatoes.



### 4. Draining and Initial Mashing

Once cooked, drain the potatoes thoroughly in a colander. Return them to the hot pot and let them sit for 2-3 minutes, allowing excess moisture to evaporate. This helps achieve fluffier mashed potatoes.



### 5. Adding the Good Stuff

Begin mashing the potatoes using a potato masher or ricer. Add the room-temperature butter gradually, incorporating it completely before adding more. Just like when making a [Festive Cheesecake](https://healtystack.com/festive-cheesecake-recipe/), temperature control is key for smooth results.



### 6. Incorporating Liquids

Slowly add the warm milk-cream mixture, continuing to mash and stir. Add the salt, white pepper, and garlic powder (if using). Keep mashing until you reach your desired consistency.



### 7. Final Touches

Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. For extra smoothness, you can use a hand mixer on low speed, but be careful not to overmix, as this can make the potatoes gummy.



## Conclusion

These classic mashed potatoes are sure to become your go-to recipe for any occasion. Their creamy, velvety texture and rich taste make them the perfect side dish for everything from holiday roasts to weeknight meatloaf.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make mashed potatoes ahead of time?

Yes, you can make mashed potatoes up to 24 hours in advance. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator. When reheating, add a splash of warm milk or cream and stir well to restore their creamy texture.



### Why are my mashed potatoes gummy?

Gummy mashed potatoes usually result from overworking the potatoes, either by mashing them too much or using a food processor. To avoid this, use a potato masher or ricer, and stop mixing once you achieve your desired consistency.



### Which potatoes are best for mashing?

Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes are ideal for mashing due to their high starch content. Yukon Golds produce a naturally buttery flavor and creamy texture, while Russets create fluffier mashed potatoes.
