## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Refrigerated pie crust
    2 packages (4 crusts total)


    Pizza sauce
    2 cups


    Shredded mozzarella cheese
    2 cups


    Pepperoni, diced
    1 cup


    Italian sausage, cooked and crumbled
    1 cup


    Green bell pepper, diced
    1/2 cup


    Red onion, finely chopped
    1/2 cup


    Mushrooms, sliced
    1/2 cup


    Italian seasoning
    1 tablespoon


    Garlic powder
    1 teaspoon


    Olive oil
    2 tablespoons


    Egg (for egg wash)
    1 large


    Grated Parmesan cheese
    1/4 cup





## Instructions


### Preparation (30 minutes)


1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). While traditional [pizza pot pies](https://healtystack.com/easy-pizza-pot-pie/) are made in larger dishes, we'll be using a muffin tin for these mini versions.



2. Lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray or olive oil.



3. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and bell peppers, cooking until softened (about 5 minutes).



4. Add sliced mushrooms and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until they release their moisture.



### Creating the Filling


5. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked vegetables with:



    - Pizza sauce

    - Diced pepperoni

    - Crumbled Italian sausage

    - Italian seasoning

    - Garlic powder



6. Mix well and set aside to cool slightly.



### Assembling the Pot Pies


7. Unroll the pie crusts on a lightly floured surface. Using a 4-inch circular cookie cutter or a large cup, cut out 12 circles for the bottoms and 12 slightly larger circles for the tops.



8. Carefully press the smaller circles into the prepared muffin cups, ensuring they reach the sides and bottom.



9. Fill each cup with:



    - 2 tablespoons of the prepared filling

    - 1 tablespoon shredded mozzarella cheese



10. Cover each filled cup with the larger pie crust circles, pressing the edges to seal with the bottom crust. For more detailed sealing techniques, visit this [comprehensive pizza pot pie guide](https://healtystack.com/pizza-pot-pie-recipe/).



### Final Touches and Baking


11. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon of water to create an egg wash.



12. Brush the top of each pot pie with the egg wash and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.



13. Cut small slits in the top of each pie to allow steam to escape.



14. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the crusts are golden brown and the filling is bubbling.



15. Allow to cool for 5-10 minutes before carefully removing from the muffin tin.



## Conclusion


These mini pizza pot pies are the perfect combination of convenience and comfort food. They're ideal for parties, family dinners, or meal prep, as they can be frozen and reheated easily. The versatility of this recipe allows you to experiment with different toppings and cheese combinations to create your perfect pizza pot pie.
