# The Ultimate Guide to Thanksgiving Sweet Potato Casserole

Sweet potato casserole is a beloved Thanksgiving tradition that perfectly bridges the gap between side dish and dessert. In this comprehensive guide, I'll share everything you need to know about creating this classic holiday dish, from selecting the perfect sweet potatoes to achieving that perfectly caramelized topping.

## Understanding Sweet Potatoes

Before we dive into the recipe, let's explore the foundation of our dish: the sweet potato. Not all sweet potatoes are created equal, and choosing the right variety can make a significant difference in your final dish.
