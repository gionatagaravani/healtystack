Add diced tomatoes, herbs, and spices of your choice (such as thyme, bay leaves, cumin, or paprika). Simmer for an additional 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld together.



### 4. Add Creaminess

Stir in coconut milk for a creamy texture. This adds richness without dairy products. You can also experiment with different plant-based alternatives, similar to those used in these [vegan pasta dishes](https://healtystack.com/vegan-pasta-dishes/).

## Frequently Asked Questions


### How can I make my vegan soup more filling?

Add protein-rich ingredients like lentils, beans, or quinoa. You can also include starchy vegetables like potatoes or sweet potatoes. Consider serving with whole grain bread or adding pasta to make it more substantial.



### Can I freeze these vegan soups?

Most vegan soups freeze exceptionally well. Store them in airtight containers for up to 3 months. When reheating, you may need to add a bit more liquid as the vegetables and legumes tend to absorb broth during storage.



### What can I use to thicken vegan soup?

There are several vegan-friendly ways to thicken soup: blend a portion of the vegetables and return them to the pot, add pureed white beans, use coconut milk, or create a slurry with cornstarch and water. You can also use potato starch or arrowroot powder.
