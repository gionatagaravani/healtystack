    Large bell peppers (any color)
    6 pieces


    Quinoa
    1½ cups


    Vegetable broth
    3 cups


    Olive oil
    2 tablespoons


    Diced onion
    1 medium


    Minced garlic
    3 cloves


    Diced tomatoes
    2 medium


    Black beans, drained and rinsed
    1 can (15 oz)


    Corn kernels
    1 cup


    Ground cumin

## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Quinoa

Start by thoroughly rinsing the quinoa under cold water using a fine-mesh strainer. This removes the natural coating called saponin, which can make quinoa taste bitter. In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa with vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy.



### 2. Prepare the Bell Peppers

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Cut the bell peppers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and membranes. If you enjoy [stuffed vegetables like our Zucchini Ricotta Bake](https://healtystack.com/zucchini-ricotta-bake/), you'll appreciate how these peppers create perfect vessels for the filling.



### 3. Make the Filling

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook until translucent (about 5 minutes). Add minced garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in diced tomatoes, black beans, corn, cumin, and paprika. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cooked quinoa to the skillet and mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste.



### 4. Stuff and Bake

Place the halved bell peppers in a large baking dish. Fill each pepper half with the quinoa mixture. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30-35 minutes. Similar to our [One-Dish Ground Turkey Sweet Potato Skillet](https://healtystack.com/one-dish-ground-turkey-sweet-potato-skillet/), this creates a perfect blend of flavors as everything cooks together.



### 5. Add Cheese and Finish

Remove the foil, sprinkle shredded cheese over the peppers, and return to the oven uncovered for an additional 5-10 minutes until the cheese is melted and slightly golden. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make these peppers ahead of time?

Yes, you can prepare the quinoa filling and stuff the peppers up to 24 hours in advance. Store them covered in the refrigerator and bake when ready to serve. You may need to add 5-10 minutes to the baking time if cooking from cold.



### What can I use instead of black beans?

You can substitute black beans with other varieties like kidney beans, pinto beans, or chickpeas. For a non-vegetarian version, you could also add ground turkey or chicken to the filling.



### Are these peppers freezer-friendly?

These stuffed peppers freeze beautifully for up to 3 months. Let them cool completely, then wrap individually in foil and store in freezer bags. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and reheat in the oven at 350°F until heated through.
