    4 stalks


    Garlic cloves, minced
    6 cloves


    Fresh thyme

    4 leaves


    Bay leaves
    2 leaves


    Olive oil
    2 tablespoons


    Salt

    To taste


    Water or chicken stock
    12 cups


    Fresh parsley, chopped
    1/4 cup





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Chicken

Begin by cleaning the chicken thoroughly under cold running water. Remove any giblets from the cavity and pat the chicken dry with paper towels. This step is crucial for achieving a clean-tasting broth. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper, both inside and out.



### 2. Start the Broth

In a large stockpot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions, carrots, and celery (also known as [mirepoix](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/mirepoix-guide)). Sauté for 5-7 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften and the onions become translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.



### 3. Build the Soup Base

Place the whole chicken in the pot and add 12 cups of water or chicken stock. Add the thyme sprigs, sage leaves, and bay leaves. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for about 1 hour or until the chicken is fully cooked.



### 4. Prepare the Butternut Squash

While the chicken is cooking, peel and cube the butternut squash into 1-inch pieces. For tips on safely cutting butternut squash, you might want to check out this guide on [how to cut butternut squash properly](https://healtystack.com/how-to-cut-butternut-squash).



### 5. Remove and Shred the Chicken

Once the chicken is cooked through, carefully remove it from the pot and let it cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, remove the skin and shred the meat into bite-sized pieces, discarding the bones.



### 6. Cook the Squash

Add the cubed butternut squash to the simmering broth. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the squash is tender when pierced with a fork but not falling apart.



### 7. Finish the Soup

Return the shredded chicken to the pot. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. Simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.



### 8. Serve

Remove the bay leaves, thyme sprigs, and sage leaves. Ladle the hot soup into bowls and garnish with fresh chopped parsley. For added nutrition, you might want to check out these [healthy soup toppings](https://healtystack.com/healthy-soup-toppings).

It's also incredibly versatile – you can adjust the seasonings to your taste or add other vegetables you have on hand.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make this soup in advance?

Yes, absolutely! In fact, many people find that the soup tastes even better the next day as the flavors have more time to develop. Store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or freeze it for up to 3 months. Just be aware that the butternut squash might become slightly softer when reheated.



### Can I use pre-cut butternut squash to save time?

While using fresh butternut squash will give you the best flavor and texture, pre-cut squash is a perfectly acceptable time-saving alternative. Just make sure it looks fresh and firm, with no signs of discoloration. You might need to adjust the cooking time slightly as pre-cut pieces are often smaller than home-cut ones.



### What can I serve with this soup?

This soup pairs wonderfully with crusty bread, a fresh green salad, or a grilled cheese sandwich.
