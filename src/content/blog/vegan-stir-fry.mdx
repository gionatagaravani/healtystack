## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Extra-firm tofu
    14 oz (400g)


    Broccoli florets
    2 cups


    Carrots, julienned
    2 medium


    Red bell pepper, sliced
    1 large


    Snow peas
    1 cup


    Shiitake mushrooms
    1 cup


    Garlic, minced
    4 cloves


    Ginger, grated
    1 tablespoon


    Soy sauce (low-sodium)
    3 tablespoons


    Rice vinegar
    1 tablespoon


    Sesame oil
    2 tablespoons


    Cornstarch
    1 tablespoon


    Vegetable broth
    1/4 cup


    Brown rice (for serving)
    2 cups cooked





## Instructions


### Step 1: Prepare the Tofu

Press the tofu between paper towels for 15-20 minutes to remove excess moisture. Cut into 1-inch cubes. This step is crucial for achieving that perfect crispy exterior that makes this dish comparable to restaurant-quality stir-fries.



### Step 2: Prepare the Sauce

In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, cornstarch, and vegetable broth until smooth. Set aside. This sauce will be the key to bringing all the flavors together.



### Step 3: Cook the Tofu

Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu cubes and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove from the pan and set aside.



### Step 4: Stir-Fry the Vegetables

In the same pan, add garlic and ginger, stir-frying for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add broccoli and carrots, stir-frying for 3 minutes. Add bell peppers and mushrooms, cooking for another 2 minutes. Finally, add snow peas and cook for 1 minute. The key is maintaining the vegetables' crispness while ensuring they're cooked through.



### Step 5: Combine and Finish

Return the tofu to the pan. Pour the sauce mixture over everything and stir continuously until the sauce thickens and coats all ingredients evenly, about 2-3 minutes.

## FAQ


### Can I prepare the vegetables in advance?

Yes, you can chop all vegetables up to 24 hours in advance and store them in airtight containers in the refrigerator. This makes the actual cooking process much quicker and more manageable.



### What can I substitute for tofu if I'm not a fan?

You can use tempeh, seitan, or even chickpeas as protein alternatives. For a soy-free option, cauliflower florets or mushrooms make excellent substitutes while still maintaining the hearty texture of the dish.



### How long can I store leftovers?

The stir-fry can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. While reheating, add a splash of water to prevent the sauce from becoming too thick.
