## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make the Yule Log Cake ahead of time?

You can prepare the cake up to 2 days in advance. Store it in the refrigerator, but bring it to room temperature about an hour before serving for the best taste and texture.



### Why did my cake crack while rolling?

Cracking usually occurs when the cake is rolled too cool or if it's overbaked. Make sure to roll the cake while it's still warm and don't overbake it. Minor cracks can be easily covered with ganache.



### Can I freeze a Yule Log Cake?

Yes, you can freeze the unfrosted cake roll for up to one month. Wrap it well in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before frosting and decorating.
