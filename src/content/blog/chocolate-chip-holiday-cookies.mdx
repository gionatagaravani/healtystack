## Ingredients






    Ingredient
    Amount


    All-purpose flour
    2¾ cups


    Unsalted butter, softened
    1 cup


    Light brown sugar
    1 cup


    Granulated sugar
    ½ cup


    Large eggs
    2


    Pure vanilla extract
    2 teaspoons


    Baking soda
    1 teaspoon


    Salt
    ½ teaspoon


    Semi-sweet chocolate chips
    2 cups


    Red and green M&Ms
    1 cup


    White chocolate chips
    ½ cup


    Ground cinnamon
    ½ teaspoon





## Instructions


### Preparation Phase


1. Begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. This prevents sticking and ensures even baking.



2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside this dry mixture for later use.



### Making the Cookie Dough


3. In a large bowl or stand mixer, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy (about 3-4 minutes). This step is crucial for achieving the perfect cookie texture.



4. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.



5. Mix in the vanilla extract until well combined.



6. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Don't overmix - this can lead to tough cookies.



### Adding the Mix-ins


7. Fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and half of the red and green M&Ms. Save the remaining M&Ms for topping the cookies.



### Baking Process


8. Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.



9. Press a few of the reserved M&Ms onto the top of each cookie dough ball for a festive appearance.



10. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they'll continue cooking as they cool.



### Cooling and Storage


11. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.



12. Once cooled, store in an airtight container for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make the cookie dough ahead of time?

You can prepare the dough up to 72 hours in advance and store it in the refrigerator. When ready to bake, let the dough come to room temperature for about 30 minutes before scooping and baking.



### Why did my cookies spread too much during baking?

Cookies typically spread too much if the butter is too soft or melted. Make sure to use room temperature butter and chill the dough if it becomes too soft. Also, ensure your baking sheets are cool between batches.



### Can these cookies be shipped as gifts?

Yes! These cookies ship well when packed carefully in an airtight container with wax paper between layers. For best results, ship them during cooler weather and use expedited shipping to maintain freshness.
