## FAQ


### How do I substitute eggs in gluten-free vegan baking?

There are several effective egg replacers for gluten-free vegan baking. Ground flaxseed mixed with water (1 tbsp flax + 3 tbsp water = 1 egg), mashed banana, or commercial egg replacers all work well. Choose based on the recipe's needs - flax works best in hearty baked goods, while banana is great for sweeter treats.



### Why did my gluten-free vegan cake turn out dense?

Gluten-free vegan baking often requires extra moisture and leavening agents. Make sure you're using enough liquid ingredients and don't skip the xanthan gum if called for - it helps mimic gluten's binding properties. Also, try adding an extra 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder to help the cake rise better.
