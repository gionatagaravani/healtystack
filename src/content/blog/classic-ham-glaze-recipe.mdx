# Classic Ham Glaze Recipe: The Perfect Sweet and Savory Coating


A perfectly glazed ham is the centerpiece of many holiday gatherings and special occasions. The classic ham glaze transforms an ordinary ham into a masterpiece, creating a glossy, flavorful coating that adds both visual appeal and a delightful taste. This time-honored recipe combines sweet and savory elements, resulting in a sticky, caramelized exterior that complements the salty ham perfectly. While it's particularly popular during Christmas and Easter, this versatile glaze works wonderfully year-round, making any dinner feel special. Just like how a [festive cheese ball](https://healtystack.com/festive-cheese-ball-recipe/) can start your meal with style, a glazed ham will surely end it on a high note.



## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Brown sugar (packed)
    1 cup


    Honey
    1/4 cup


    Dijon mustard
    2 tablespoons


    Apple cider vinegar
    2 tablespoons


    Ground cinnamon
    1/4 teaspoon


    Ground cloves
    1/8 teaspoon


    Ground nutmeg
    1/8 teaspoon


    Black pepper
    1/4 teaspoon





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Base

In a medium saucepan, combine the brown sugar and honey. Mix them thoroughly to create a sweet base for your glaze. The brown sugar provides depth of flavor while the honey adds shine and helps create that perfect sticky consistency.



### 2. Add the Mustard

Incorporate the Dijon mustard into the sugar mixture. This adds a tangy kick that balances the sweetness and helps the glaze adhere to the ham. The mustard also contributes to the beautiful golden color of the final product.



### 3. Include the Vinegar

Pour in the apple cider vinegar and stir well. The vinegar's acidity helps cut through the richness of both the glaze and the ham, creating a more balanced flavor profile. Just as [chocolate bark](https://healtystack.com/simple-chocolate-bark-recipe/) needs the right balance of sweetness, your ham glaze needs this acidic component.



### 4. Spice it Up

Add the ground cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and black pepper. These warm spices add complexity and depth to the glaze, creating an aromatic mixture that will make your kitchen smell amazing.



### 5. Heat and Combine

Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, stirring constantly. Continue cooking for about 5 minutes until the sugar has completely dissolved and the glaze has slightly thickened.



### 6. Apply to Ham

Before applying the glaze, score your ham in a diamond pattern if it isn't pre-scored. This allows the glaze to penetrate deeper into the meat. Apply the glaze generously using a basting brush, making sure to get it into all the scored areas.



### 7. Baking Process

For a pre-cooked ham, apply the glaze during the last 30 minutes of heating. Increase the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) during this time to help caramelize the glaze. Baste the ham every 10 minutes with the glaze that runs off into the pan.



### 8. Final Touches

Once the ham is done, let it rest for 15-20 minutes before slicing. This allows the glaze to set and ensures the juices redistribute throughout the meat. The result will be just as impressive as a [festive cheesecake](https://healtystack.com/festive-cheesecake-recipe/) on your holiday table.



## Conclusion

This classic ham glaze recipe creates the perfect balance of sweet, savory, and spicy flavors that complement any ham perfectly. The combination of brown sugar and honey provides a gorgeous shine, while the mustard and spices add depth and complexity. Whether you're preparing a holiday feast or a special Sunday dinner, this glaze will elevate your ham to new heights of deliciousness.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make this glaze ahead of time?

The glaze can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Warm it slightly before using to restore its liquid consistency.



### What type of ham works best with this glaze?

This glaze works well with any type of ham, but it's particularly delicious on spiral-cut hams or bone-in hams. The important thing is to use a ham that hasn't been pre-glazed.



### Can I substitute the honey with something else?

Yes, you can substitute honey with maple syrup or agave nectar. Each will provide a slightly different flavor profile but will still create a delicious glaze with the right consistency.
