## Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Rice

Start by cooking the brown rice according to package instructions. For extra flavor, try cooking it in [vegetable broth](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/vegetable-broth-240934) instead of water. While the rice cooks, you can prepare the other components.



### 2. Roast the Sweet Potatoes

- Toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon chili powder, salt, and pepper
- Spread on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper
- Roast for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and tender


### 3. Prepare the Black Beans


- Drain and rinse the black beans
- Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat
- Add diced red onion and sauté until translucent (about 5 minutes)
- Add beans, remaining cumin, chili powder, and garlic powder
- Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally
- Season with salt and pepper to taste


### 4. Prepare the Vegetables


- Slice bell peppers into thin strips
- If using fresh corn, char it in a dry skillet; if frozen, thaw and warm through
- Dice avocados and toss with lime juice to prevent browning
- Chop fresh cilantro
- Slice remaining lime into wedges


### 5. Assemble the Bowls


- Start with a base of brown rice
- Add a generous portion of seasoned black beans
- Arrange roasted sweet potatoes
- Add bell peppers and corn
- Top with diced avocado
