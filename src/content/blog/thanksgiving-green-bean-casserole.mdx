## Instructions


### Step 1: Prepare the Green Beans

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
2. Add trimmed green beans and blanch for 5 minutes until bright green and crisp-tender.
3. Immediately transfer to an ice bath to stop the cooking process.
4. Drain well and set aside.

### Step 2: Make the Mushroom Sauce

Similar to this [cream of mushroom version](https://healtystack.com/green-bean-casserole-with-cream-of-mushroom-soup/), but made from scratch:
1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
2. Add diced onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Add mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 8-10 minutes.
4. Add minced garlic and fresh thyme, cooking for another minute.
5. Sprinkle flour over the mixture and stir constantly for 1-2 minutes.
6. Gradually add chicken broth while stirring constantly to prevent lumps.
7. Pour in heavy cream and continue stirring until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
8. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Step 3: Combine and Bake

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the blanched green beans with the mushroom sauce.
3. Transfer the mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish.
4. Top with 1 cup of crispy fried onions and grated Parmesan cheese.
5. Bake for 25 minutes until bubbly.
6. Add remaining crispy onions and bake for an additional 5 minutes until golden brown, similar to this [crispy onion variation](https://healtystack.com/green-bean-casserole-with-crispy-onions/).

## FAQ


### Can I make this green bean casserole ahead of time?

Yes, you can assemble the casserole up to 24 hours in advance. Keep it covered in the refrigerator, but wait to add the crispy onion topping until just before baking to maintain their crunch.



### Can I use frozen green beans instead of fresh?

While fresh green beans provide the best texture, you can use frozen green beans in a pinch. Thaw them completely and pat dry before using. Avoid canned green beans as they tend to become mushy in the casserole.
