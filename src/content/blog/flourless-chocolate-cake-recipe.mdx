        12 ounces
    
    
        Unsalted butter
        1 cup (2 sticks)
    
    
        Granulated sugar
        1 cup
    
    
        Large eggs
        6
    
    
        Dutch-processed cocoa powder

## Instructions


### Preparation

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Prepare a 9-inch springform pan by greasing it thoroughly and lining the bottom with parchment paper. Wrap the outside of the pan with aluminum foil to prevent any water from seeping in during baking.



### Making the Cake

2. Start by chopping the dark chocolate into small, uniform pieces. If you enjoy experimenting with chocolate, you might want to check out this [chocolate bark recipe](https://healtystack.com/simple-chocolate-bark-recipe/) for more chocolate-based treats.



3. In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over simmering water, combine the chopped chocolate and butter. Stir occasionally until completely melted and smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.



4. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar and eggs until well combined and slightly lightened in color, about 3-4 minutes.



5. Gradually add the melted chocolate mixture to the egg mixture, whisking constantly to ensure even incorporation.



6. Sift the cocoa powder over the mixture and add the espresso powder (if using), vanilla extract, and salt. Fold gently until all ingredients are well combined.



### Baking

7. Pour the batter into the prepared springform pan, smoothing the top with a spatula.



8. Place the springform pan in a larger roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan.



9. Carefully transfer the water bath setup to the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the cake is set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center.



### Finishing

10. Remove the cake from the water bath and let it cool completely on a wire rack.



11. Once cooled, refrigerate the cake for at least 4 hours or overnight for best results.



12. Before serving, run a warm knife around the edges of the pan and release the springform sides. For a finishing touch, dust with cocoa powder or top with fresh berries.



## Conclusion

This flourless chocolate cake is a testament to the magic of simple, quality ingredients combined with proper technique. While it takes some time and patience to prepare, the result is an incredibly rich, smooth, and sophisticated dessert that's perfect for any special occasion. Whether you're serving it alongside other treats like a [glazed ham](https://healtystack.com/classic-ham-glaze-recipe/) at a dinner party or enjoying it on its own, this cake is sure to impress.
