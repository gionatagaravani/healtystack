Pizza meets pot pie in this ingenious fusion dish that brings together the best of both worlds.

## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)
    2 pounds


    Pizza sauce
    2 cups


    Mozzarella cheese, shredded
    2 cups


    Italian sausage, cooked and crumbled
    1 pound


    Pepperoni slices
    4 ounces


    Bell peppers, diced
    1 cup


    Mushrooms, sliced
    1 cup


    Red onion, diced
    1/2 cup


    Olive oil
    2 tablespoons


    Italian seasoning
    1 tablespoon


    Garlic powder
    1 teaspoon


    Egg (for egg wash)
    1 large


    Parmesan cheese, grated
    1/4 cup





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Preparation

First, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven is heating up, grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil or cooking spray. This size dish is perfect for achieving the right depth for our pot pie, similar to how we layer ingredients in this delicious [Slow Cooker Green Bean Casserole](https://healtystack.com/slow-cooker-green-bean-casserole/).



### 2. Prepare the Filling

In a large skillet over medium heat, warm one tablespoon of olive oil. Add the diced bell peppers, mushrooms, and red onion. Sauté until the vegetables are softened but still maintain some crunch, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.



### 3. Assemble the Base

Divide your pizza dough into two portions, using about 60% for the bottom crust and 40% for the top. Roll out the larger portion on a floured surface until it's large enough to cover the bottom and sides of your baking dish with some overhang. Carefully transfer the dough to the prepared dish, pressing it gently against the bottom and sides.



### 4. Layer the Ingredients

Now comes the fun part! Start layering your ingredients in this order:
- Spread 1 cup of pizza sauce evenly over the bottom crust
- Sprinkle 1 cup of mozzarella cheese
- Add half of the crumbled Italian sausage
- Layer half of the pepperoni slices
- Add the sautéed vegetable mixture
- Sprinkle with Italian seasoning and garlic powder
- Add remaining sausage and pepperoni
- Top with remaining sauce and mozzarella cheese

### 5. Create the Top Crust

Roll out the remaining dough portion into a rectangle that will fit the top of your dish. Place it over the filling and crimp the edges together with the bottom crust to seal. Cut several slits in the top to allow steam to escape.



### 6. Add the Finishing Touches

Beat the egg with a tablespoon of water to create an egg wash. Brush the top crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and a light dusting of Italian seasoning.



### 7. Bake to Perfection

Place the pot pie in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling through the steam vents. If the top starts to brown too quickly, cover loosely with aluminum foil.



### 8. Cool and Serve

Allow the pot pie to cool for 10-15 minutes before serving. This resting time helps the filling set and makes it easier to slice, similar to how we let our [Gluten-Free Cheeseburger Quesadillas](https://healtystack.com/gluten-free-cheeseburger-quesadillas/) rest before serving.



## Conclusion

This Easy Pizza Pot Pie is more than just a meal – it's a celebration of comfort food innovation. The combination of flaky crust, savory filling, and classic pizza flavors creates an unforgettable dining experience that will have your family and friends asking for seconds. Whether you're looking to switch up your regular pizza night or wanting to try something new for dinner, this recipe delivers both familiarity and excitement in every bite.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make this recipe ahead of time?

Yes! You can assemble the pot pie up to 24 hours in advance and keep it refrigerated. When ready to bake, allow it to come to room temperature for about 30 minutes before putting it in the oven. You might need to add 5-10 minutes to the baking time if it's still cold from the refrigerator.



### Can I freeze this Pizza Pot Pie?

Absolutely! You can freeze it either before or after baking. If freezing unbaked, wrap it well in plastic wrap and foil, and it will keep for up to 3 months. When ready to bake, thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bake as directed, adding about 10-15 minutes to the baking time. If freezing after baking, let it cool completely before wrapping and freezing. Reheat in a 350°F oven until heated through.



### What substitutions can I make for the toppings?

Feel free to customize your pot pie with your favorite pizza toppings! Just be mindful not to use ingredients with too much moisture, as this could make the crust soggy. Pre-cook any meat toppings and vegetables that release a lot of water during cooking.
