    Fresh green beans, trimmed
    2 pounds


    Fresh mushrooms, sliced
    16 ounces


    Yellow onion, diced
    1 medium


    Garlic cloves, minced
    4


    Extra virgin olive oil
    2 tablespoons


    Whole wheat flour
    3 tablespoons


    Low-sodium vegetable broth
    1½ cups


    Unsweetened almond milk
    1 cup


    Greek yogurt, plain
    ½ cup


    Thyme, fresh
    1 tablespoon


    Whole grain breadcrumbs
    1 cup


    Sliced almonds
    ½ cup


    Sea salt
    1 teaspoon


    Black pepper, freshly ground
    ½ teaspoon





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Green Beans

Begin by bringing a large pot of water to a boil. While waiting, prepare an ice bath in a large bowl. Add the trimmed green beans to the boiling water and cook for 5 minutes until bright green and crisp-tender. Immediately transfer the beans to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Drain well and set aside.



### 2. Create the Mushroom Sauce Base

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced onions and cook for 3-4 minutes until they begin to soften. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add sliced mushrooms and cook for 7-8 minutes until they release their moisture and begin to brown.

### 3. Make the Sauce

Sprinkle whole wheat flour over the mushroom mixture and stir constantly for 1-2 minutes to cook the flour. Gradually add the vegetable broth while stirring continuously to prevent lumps. Add almond milk and continue stirring until the sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in Greek yogurt, thyme, salt, and pepper.



### 4. Prepare the Topping

In a medium bowl, combine whole grain breadcrumbs and sliced almonds. For extra flavor, you might want to check out this [crispy onion topping variation](https://healtystack.com/green-bean-casserole-with-crispy-onions/).



### 5. Assemble and Bake

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Combine the green beans with the mushroom sauce and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Top evenly with the breadcrumb-almond mixture.



### 6. Final Baking

Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes until the topping is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling around the edges. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.



## Conclusion


This healthy green bean casserole proves that classic comfort foods can be transformed into nutritious dishes without sacrificing flavor. The combination of fresh ingredients, homemade mushroom sauce, and crunchy whole-grain topping creates a dish that's both satisfying and wholesome. Whether you're serving it at a holiday gathering or enjoying it as a weeknight side dish, this recipe offers a perfect balance of nutrition and taste that will please both health-conscious diners and traditional food lovers alike.



## FAQ


### Can I make this recipe ahead of time?

Yes, you can prepare the casserole up to 24 hours in advance. Assemble everything except the topping, cover, and refrigerate. Add the topping just before baking and increase the baking time by 5-10 minutes since you're starting with a cold dish.



### Is this recipe gluten-free?

This recipe contains gluten in the whole wheat flour and breadcrumbs. However, you can easily make it gluten-free by substituting these ingredients with gluten-free alternatives like rice flour and gluten-free breadcrumbs.



### How long will leftovers keep?

Stored in an airtight container, leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F for best results, though microwave reheating also works.
