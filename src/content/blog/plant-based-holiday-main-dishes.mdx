# Spectacular Plant-Based Holiday Main Dishes That Will Impress Everyone


The holiday season is a time for gathering, celebration, and memorable meals. Gone are the days when plant-based diners had to settle for side dishes during festive occasions. Today's plant-based cuisine offers sophisticated, delicious alternatives that can take center stage at any holiday table. Whether you're hosting vegans, vegetarians, or simply want to incorporate more plant-based options into your holiday menu, these main dishes will delight and satisfy all your guests. From hearty roasts to elegant stuffed vegetables, these recipes prove that holiday fare can be both festive and cruelty-free, while still maintaining the traditional flavors we all love, just like [grandmother's classic roast](https://healtystack.com/grandma-s-christmas-roast/) but with a compassionate twist.



## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Seitan (vital wheat gluten)
    2 cups


    Nutritional yeast
    1/4 cup


    Vegetable broth
    2 cups


    Mushrooms (mixed varieties)
    1 pound


    Onions
    2 large


    Carrots
    3 medium


    Celery
    4 stalks


    Garlic
    6 cloves


    Fresh rosemary
    2 tablespoons


    Fresh thyme
    2 tablespoons


    Tamari or soy sauce
    1/4 cup


    Olive oil
    1/3 cup


    Fresh sage
    2 tablespoons





## Instructions


### Step 1: Prepare the Base

Begin by combining the vital wheat gluten and nutritional yeast in a large bowl. This forms the foundation of our holiday roast, providing a satisfying, protein-rich base that will hold all our wonderful flavors. While working with seitan might seem intimidating at first, it's actually quite forgiving and becomes easier with practice.



### Step 2: Create the Flavor Base

In a food processor, combine mushrooms, one onion, two cloves of garlic, and herbs until finely chopped. This mixture will infuse our roast with deep, savory flavors that remind us of traditional holiday meals. The mushrooms add an essential umami element that makes this dish particularly satisfying.



### Step 3: Combine and Knead

Mix the processed vegetables into the seitan base, adding vegetable broth gradually until a dough-like consistency forms. Knead for about 10 minutes, which develops the gluten and creates a meat-like texture. This step is crucial for achieving the perfect consistency.



### Step 4: Shape and Wrap

Form the mixture into a roast shape and wrap tightly in foil, making sure to leave some room for expansion. This technique helps create that classic roast appearance that's perfect for slicing at the dinner table.



### Step 5: Prepare the Vegetables

While the roast is cooking, prepare your remaining vegetables for roasting. Cut carrots, celery, and the remaining onion into large chunks. Toss with olive oil, remaining garlic, and herbs. These will create a beautiful bed for serving your roast, similar to how you might serve a [traditional holiday roast](https://healtystack.com/grandma-s-christmas-roast/).



### Step 6: Cook and Baste

Bake the roast at 350°F (175°C) for 90 minutes, basting every 30 minutes with a mixture of tamari and vegetable broth. This ensures a moist, flavorful result that will impress your guests. Add the prepared vegetables to the roasting pan in the last 45 minutes of cooking.



### Step 7: Rest and Serve

Let the roast rest for 15 minutes before unwrapping and slicing. This allows the flavors to settle and makes for easier cutting. Serve with the roasted vegetables and your favorite holiday sides.



## Conclusion


Creating a memorable plant-based holiday main dish doesn't have to be complicated or intimidating. This recipe proves that plant-based cooking can be just as festive and satisfying as traditional holiday fare. Pair it with some [vegan eggnog alternatives](https://healtystack.com/vegan-eggnog-alternatives/) for drinks and finish with some [quick peppermint fudge](https://healtystack.com/quick-peppermint-fudge/) for dessert to complete your holiday meal. Remember, the key to success is in the preparation and allowing yourself time to enjoy the cooking process. Your guests will be amazed at how delicious and satisfying a plant-based holiday meal can be.



## FAQ


### Can I prepare this roast in advance?

You can prepare the roast up to two days in advance. Store it wrapped in the refrigerator and reheat it covered in foil at 350°F for about 25 minutes before serving. Just be sure to let it come to room temperature before reheating.



### What if I can't find vital wheat gluten?

While vital wheat gluten is the best option for this recipe, you can create alternative holiday main dishes using portobello mushrooms, stuffed squash, or lentil loaf. These options are equally delicious and festive, though they'll have a different texture than the seitan roast.



### How can I ensure my roast doesn't turn out rubbery?

The key to avoiding a rubbery texture is not over-kneading the seitan and maintaining consistent moisture while cooking. Follow the basting instructions carefully and don't skip the resting period after cooking. This will help achieve the perfect texture.
