## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Pizza dough
    1 pound (homemade or store-bought)


    Fresh basil pesto
    1 cup


    Mozzarella cheese, shredded
    2 cups


    Cherry tomatoes
    1 cup, halved


    Bell peppers (assorted colors)
    2 medium, sliced


    Red onion
    1 medium, thinly sliced


    Baby spinach
    2 cups


    Artichoke hearts
    1 cup, quartered


    Fresh garlic
    4 cloves, minced

    To taste





## Instructions


### Prepare the Base

1. Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.



2. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza dough into a 14-inch circle, about 1/4 inch thick. If you enjoy [cooking from scratch](https://healtystack.com/slow-cooked-coffee-beef-roast/), making your own dough can be incredibly rewarding.



3. Transfer the dough to a pizza pan or prepared baking sheet lined with parchment paper.



### Prepare the Toppings

4. In a medium bowl, toss sliced vegetables with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.



5. Brush the pizza dough with the remaining olive oil, focusing on the edges to ensure a golden crust.



6. Spread the pesto evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border for the crust.



### Assembly and Baking

7. Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella over the pesto layer.



8. Arrange the seasoned vegetables artfully over the cheese. Consider creating a pattern similar to what you might see in [fine dining presentations](https://healtystack.com/south-seas-mango-halibut/).



9. Add the remaining mozzarella cheese on top of the vegetables.



10. If desired, sprinkle red pepper flakes for an extra kick.



11. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.



### Finishing Touches

12. Remove from oven and let rest for 2-3 minutes.



13. Garnish with fresh basil leaves.



14. Slice and serve immediately while hot.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make this pizza vegan?

You can easily make this pizza vegan by using dairy-free pesto and replacing mozzarella with vegan cheese alternatives. You might also consider adding nutritional yeast for an extra cheesy flavor.



### Can I prepare the components ahead of time?

The pesto can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Vegetables can be sliced and stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before assembling the pizza.



### How do I prevent my pizza from getting soggy?

To prevent a soggy crust, avoid overloading with too many toppings. Also, make sure your pesto isn't too oily, and if using wet vegetables like tomatoes, try to remove excess moisture before adding them to the pizza.
