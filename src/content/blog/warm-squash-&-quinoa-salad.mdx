## Ingredients



    
        Ingredient
        Amount
    
    
        Butternut squash, cubed
        2 cups
    
    
        Quinoa
        1 cup
    
    
        Olive oil
        3 tablespoons
    
    
        Baby spinach
        3 cups
    
    
        Dried cranberries
        1/3 cup
    
    
        Toasted pumpkin seeds
        1/4 cup
    
    
        Red onion, thinly sliced
        1/2 medium
    
    
        Maple syrup
        2 tablespoons
    
    
        Apple cider vinegar
        2 tablespoons
    
    
        Dijon mustard
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Fresh thyme
        2 sprigs
    
    
        Salt
        To taste
    
    
        Black pepper

## Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Squash

Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Toss the cubed butternut squash with 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread evenly on a baking sheet and roast for 25-30 minutes, stirring halfway through, until tender and slightly caramelized.



### 2. Cook the Quinoa

While the squash is roasting, rinse the quinoa thoroughly under cold water. Combine with 2 cups of water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer covered for about 15-20 minutes until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy.



### 3. Prepare the Dressing

In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons olive oil, maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard. Season with salt and pepper to taste. This dressing will complement the dish just as wonderfully as the sauce in our [healthy vegan pizza](https://healtystack.com/healthy-vegan-pizza/) recipe.



### 4. Toast the Pumpkin Seeds

In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the pumpkin seeds until they start to pop and become fragrant, about 3-5 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning.



### 5. Assemble the Salad

In a large bowl, combine the warm quinoa and roasted squash. Add the baby spinach while the quinoa is still warm to slightly wilt the leaves. Add the sliced red onion, dried cranberries, and most of the toasted pumpkin seeds (reserve some for garnish).



### 6. Final Touches

Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine. Strip the thyme leaves from their stems and sprinkle over the salad. Top with the reserved pumpkin seeds.



## Conclusion

This Warm Squash & Quinoa Salad is a perfect example of how healthy eating doesn't mean sacrificing flavor or satisfaction. It's versatile enough to serve as a main course or as a side dish, similar to how our [plant-based tacos](https://healtystack.com/plant-based-tacos/) can be adapted for various occasions. The combination of warm and cold elements, along with the mix of textures from crispy seeds to tender squash, creates an exciting eating experience that will have you coming back for more.



## FAQ


### Can I make this salad ahead of time?

You can prepare the components (roasted squash, quinoa, and dressing) up to 2 days in advance and store them separately in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, warm the quinoa and squash slightly, then assemble with the fresh ingredients and dressing.



### What can I substitute for butternut squash?

Sweet potato, pumpkin, or acorn squash work great as alternatives. Just adjust the roasting time accordingly as different squash varieties may cook faster or slower.



### Is this recipe suitable for special diets?

This recipe is naturally vegan, gluten-free, and can be made nut-free by omitting any nut-based additions. It's also rich in protein from the quinoa and seeds, making it suitable for various dietary preferences.
