    1/2 cup
  
  
    Pecans or walnuts
    1/2 cup, chopped
  
  
    Olive oil
    2 tablespoons
  
  
    Maple syrup
    1 tablespoon
  
  
    Dijon mustard
    1 teaspoon
  
  
    Apple cider vinegar
    2 tablespoons
  
  
    Salt
    1/2 teaspoon
  
  
    Black pepper
    1/4 teaspoon
  
  
    Goat cheese or feta (optional)
    1/2 cup, crumbled
  




## Instructions



  - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

  - In a large bowl, toss the cubed butternut squash with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread the squash in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.

  - Roast the squash for 25-30 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until tender and lightly caramelized. Set aside to cool.

  - While the squash is roasting, prepare the kale. Remove the stems and chop the leaves into bite-sized pieces. Massage the kale with your hands for a minute or two to soften it and make it more tender.

  - In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, maple syrup, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper to make the dressing.

  - In a large serving bowl, combine the massaged kale, cooled roasted butternut squash, sliced red onion, dried cranberries, and chopped pecans or walnuts.

  - Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss well to combine, ensuring all ingredients are evenly coated.

  - If desired, top the salad with crumbled goat cheese or feta for added creaminess and flavor.

  - Serve the salad immediately, or chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.



This butternut squash and kale salad is not only delicious but also versatile. You can easily customize it to your liking by adding your favorite ingredients or swapping out items you don't prefer. For example, you can replace the pecans or walnuts with pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds for a nut-free option.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### 1. Can I make this salad ahead of time?

Yes, you can prepare the components of the salad ahead of time, such as roasting the butternut squash and chopping the kale. However, I recommend waiting to add the dressing until just before serving to prevent the salad from becoming soggy.



### 2. Can I substitute the kale with another green?

Absolutely! If you're not a fan of kale or don't have it on hand, you can use other hearty greens like spinach, arugula, or Swiss chard. Just keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.



### 3. How long will leftovers keep in the refrigerator?

Leftover butternut squash and kale salad can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The kale may wilt slightly over time, but the flavors will continue to develop and meld together.
