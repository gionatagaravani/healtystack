Don't be afraid to mix and match different elements to create your own signature topping combination.



## FAQ


### Q: Can I make these toppings gluten-free?

A: Yes! Replace regular breadcrumbs with gluten-free alternatives, and use gluten-free crackers or crushed cornflakes instead of wheat-based options. Just ensure all other ingredients are certified gluten-free.



### Q: How do I prevent my toppings from getting soggy?

A: Add the toppings during the last 15-20 minutes of baking time, and make sure your casserole isn't too liquid-heavy. You can also pre-toast breadcrumbs or nuts for extra crunch.



### Q: Can I freeze casseroles with these toppings?

A: It's best to freeze the casserole and topping separately. Add fresh toppings just before baking to maintain their texture and crunch. This ensures the best results when reheating.
