## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    All-purpose flour
    2¾ cups


    Unsweetened cocoa powder
    3 tablespoons


    Granulated sugar
    2 cups


    Baking soda
    1 teaspoon


    Salt
    1 teaspoon


    Eggs
    3 large


    Vegetable oil
    1½ cups


    Buttermilk
    1 cup


    Red food coloring
    2 tablespoons


    Vanilla extract
    2 teaspoons


    White vinegar
    1 teaspoon





### For the Cream Cheese Frosting:



    Ingredient
    Amount


    Cream cheese
    16 oz


    Unsalted butter
    1 cup


    Powdered sugar
    4 cups


    Vanilla extract
    2 teaspoons





## Instructions


### Preparing the Cake:


1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, lining the bottoms with parchment paper.



2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda. Set aside.



3. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, sugar, and vegetable oil until well combined and slightly lighter in color (about 2 minutes).



4. Add the buttermilk, vanilla extract, and red food coloring to the wet ingredients. Mix until fully incorporated. The batter should be a vibrant red color.



5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.



6. Stir in the vinegar. This helps to enhance the red color and creates a tender crumb.



7. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.



8. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.



9. Allow cakes to cool in pans for 10 minutes, then remove and cool completely on wire racks.



### Making the Frosting:


1. In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy (about 3 minutes).



2. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing on low speed to avoid a mess.



3. Add vanilla extract and beat until light and fluffy (about 5 minutes).



### Assembly and Decoration:


1. Once the cakes are completely cool, level them if needed using a serrated knife.



2. Place one layer on a cake stand or serving plate. If you're looking for more holiday dessert ideas, check out these [no-bake Christmas desserts](https://healtystack.com/no-bake-christmas-dessert/).



3. Spread about 1 cup of frosting evenly on top of the first layer.



4. Place the second layer on top and apply a thin crumb coat of frosting all over the cake. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.



5. Apply the final coat of frosting, creating smooth sides and top.



6. For a festive touch, decorate with sugared cranberries, rosemary sprigs, or white chocolate snowflakes. You might also be interested in pairing this with a [festive cheesecake](https://healtystack.com/festive-cheesecake-recipe/) for variety.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make this cake in advance?

Yes, you can bake the cake layers up to 2 days in advance. Wrap them well in plastic wrap and store at room temperature. The assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Just bring it to room temperature before serving.



### Why is my red velvet cake not red enough?

The intensity of the red color depends on the brand and amount of food coloring used. For a deeper red, ensure you're using gel food coloring rather than liquid, as it provides more concentrated color. Also, make sure your cocoa powder isn't too dark, as this can affect the final color.



### Can I substitute the buttermilk?

If you don't have buttermilk, you can make a substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to 1 cup of regular milk. Let it stand for 5 minutes before using.
