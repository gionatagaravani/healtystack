        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Cornstarch (for gravy)
        2 tablespoons
    




## Instructions


### Preparation

1. Begin by brewing your coffee strong and allowing it to cool to room temperature. This prevents the meat from seizing when added to the slow cooker.



2. In a small bowl, combine paprika, salt, pepper, and dried thyme to create your spice rub.



3. Pat the beef roast dry with paper towels and generously coat all sides with the spice mixture.



### Searing and Setting Up

4. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add a tablespoon of oil and sear the roast on all sides until golden brown (about 3-4 minutes per side).



5. While the meat is searing, prepare your slow cooker by placing diced onions and carrots at the bottom.



### Slow Cooking Process

6. Place the seared roast on top of the vegetables in your slow cooker.



7. In a medium bowl, combine the cooled coffee, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, and minced garlic. Mix well.



8. Pour the liquid mixture over the roast and vegetables.



9. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours, or on high for 5-6 hours, until the meat is fork-tender.



### Making the Gravy

10. Once the cooking is complete, carefully remove the roast and vegetables to a serving platter and cover with foil.



11. Pour the remaining liquid into a saucepan. In a small bowl, whisk cornstarch with 1/4 cup cold water until smooth.



12. Bring the liquid to a simmer and slowly whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Cook until thickened, about 3-5 minutes.



### Serving

13. Slice the roast against the grain and arrange on a platter with the vegetables.



14. Pour the hot gravy over the meat and vegetables, or serve on the side.



This hearty dish pairs wonderfully with roasted potatoes, crusty bread, or if you're looking for lighter alternatives, consider serving it alongside some [healthy sides](https://healtystack.com/healthy-vegan-pizza/) or even trying some [plant-based options](https://healtystack.com/plant-based-tacos/) as accompaniments.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I use decaf coffee in this recipe?

Yes, you can absolutely use decaf coffee without affecting the flavor profile. The important thing is to ensure it's strongly brewed to maintain the rich taste that makes this dish special.



### Why does my roast sometimes turn out tough?

Tough roast typically results from either not cooking it long enough or cooking it at too high a temperature. For the most tender results, stick to the low setting and make sure the internal temperature reaches at least 195°F (91°C) to break down the tough connective tissues.



### Can I prepare this recipe the night before?

You can definitely prep all ingredients the night before. Store the spice-rubbed meat and prepared vegetables separately in the refrigerator. In the morning, just sear the meat and combine everything in the slow cooker.
