## Instructions


### Step 1: Prepare the Base

Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add diced onions and sauté for 5 minutes until translucent. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. This aromatic base will set the foundation for our flavorful chili.



### Step 2: Add the Vegetables

Add diced bell peppers to the pot and cook for 3-4 minutes until they begin to soften. Just like in our [favorite vegan soups](https://healtystack.com/vegan-soup-recipes/), the key is to layer the flavors gradually.



### Step 3: Brown the Plant-Based Meat

Add the plant-based ground meat substitute to the pot. Break it up with a wooden spoon and cook until it's browned and slightly crispy, about 5-7 minutes.



### Step 4: Season the Mixture

Add chili powder, cumin, and smoked paprika. Stir well to combine and cook for 1-2 minutes to toast the spices and release their flavors.



### Step 5: Add Remaining Ingredients

Pour in the diced tomatoes, vegetable broth, black beans, kidney beans, and corn. Stir to combine all ingredients thoroughly.



### Step 6: Simmer

Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The chili should thicken and the flavors will meld together beautifully.



### Step 7: Final Seasoning

Taste and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. If desired, add more chili powder for extra heat.



## Serving Suggestions

Serve hot with your favorite toppings such as:
- Diced avocado
- Vegan sour cream
- Chopped cilantro
- Lime wedges
- Crushed tortilla chips
- Vegan shredded cheese

For a complete meal, consider serving with [vegan cornbread pancakes](https://healtystack.com/vegan-pancakes/) on the side.
