    1 pound


    Sweet potatoes, diced
    2 medium


    Yellow onion, diced
    1 medium


    Bell peppers, mixed colors
    2 medium


    Garlic cloves, minced
    3


    Olive oil
    2 tablespoons

    1 tablespoon

    Black pepper
    ½ teaspoon


    Fresh spinach
    2 cups


    Chicken broth
    ½ cup





## Preparation Instructions


### 1. Preparation Phase

Begin by washing and peeling the sweet potatoes, then cut them into ½-inch cubes. Dice the onion and bell peppers into similar-sized pieces to ensure even cooking. Mince the garlic cloves and set aside. Having all ingredients prepared before cooking, similar to our [South Seas Mango Halibut](https://healtystack.com/south-seas-mango-halibut/) preparation method, ensures smooth cooking process.



### 2. Initial Cooking

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the diced sweet potatoes. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften and develop a slight golden color.



### 3. Adding Aromatics

Add the diced onion and bell peppers to the skillet. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until the onions become translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.



### 4. Cooking the Turkey

Push the vegetables to one side of the skillet and add the ground turkey to the other side. Break up the turkey into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Season with paprika, cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix the turkey with the seasonings and cook until it's no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes.



### 5. Combining and Finishing

Once the turkey is cooked through, mix it with the vegetables. Add the chicken broth to help steam the sweet potatoes to complete tenderness, similar to the moisture-retention technique used in our [Slow-Cooked Coffee Beef Roast](https://healtystack.com/slow-cooked-coffee-beef-roast/). Cover the skillet and let it simmer for 5 minutes.



### 6. Final Touches

Add the fresh spinach on top and cover again. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes until the spinach wilts. Stir everything together and adjust seasoning to taste.
