When summer gardens overflow with fresh zucchini, there's no better way to transform this versatile vegetable than in a comforting, cheesy Zucchini Ricotta Bake. This Mediterranean-inspired casserole combines layers of tender zucchini with creamy ricotta cheese, aromatic herbs, and a golden parmesan crust. It's a perfect dish that bridges the gap between healthy eating and comfort food, much like this delightful [South Seas Mango Halibut](https://healtystack.com/south-seas-mango-halibut/). Whether served as a main vegetarian dish or a hearty side, this bake celebrates the natural sweetness of zucchini while creating a satisfying meal that's both nutritious and delicious.



## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Medium zucchini, thinly sliced
    4


    Whole milk ricotta cheese
    15 oz


    Grated Parmesan cheese
    1 cup


    Large eggs
    2


    Fresh basil, chopped
    1/4 cup


    Fresh oregano, chopped
    2 tablespoons


    Garlic cloves, minced
    3


    Olive oil
    3 tablespoons


    Salt
    1 teaspoon


    Black pepper
    1/2 teaspoon


    Mozzarella cheese, shredded
    1 cup


    Italian breadcrumbs
    1/2 cup





## Instructions


### 1. Preparation

Begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven heats up, grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with olive oil. This step ensures your casserole won't stick and adds a subtle flavor that complements the Mediterranean ingredients, similar to how we prepare our [Kimchi Cauliflower Fried Rice](https://healtystack.com/kimchi-cauliflower-fried-rice/).



### 2. Prepare the Zucchini

Slice the zucchini into thin, uniform rounds (about 1/4 inch thick). Lay the slices on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Let them sit for 15 minutes to draw out excess moisture. This crucial step prevents your bake from becoming watery. Pat the slices dry with paper towels.



### 3. Make the Ricotta Mixture

In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, one cup of grated Parmesan, eggs, chopped basil, oregano, minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. The mixture should be creamy and well-seasoned.



### 4. Initial Layer

Brush the bottom of the prepared baking dish with olive oil. Arrange a layer of zucchini slices, slightly overlapping them like shingles. This creates a sturdy base for your casserole.



### 5. Building the Layers

Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the zucchini layer. Sprinkle with a portion of the mozzarella cheese. Continue layering zucchini, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella two more times, finishing with a layer of zucchini on top.



### 6. Create the Topping

Mix the remaining Parmesan cheese with the Italian breadcrumbs. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the top layer. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil to help achieve a golden-brown crust.



### 7. Baking

Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes until the top is golden brown and the casserole is bubbling around the edges. The cooking process is as precise as our [Slow-Cooked Coffee Beef Roast](https://healtystack.com/slow-cooked-coffee-beef-roast/).



### 8. Finishing

Let the bake rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set and makes serving easier. Garnish with additional fresh basil if desired.



## Conclusion

This Zucchini Ricotta Bake is a testament to how simple ingredients can create an extraordinary dish. The combination of tender zucchini, creamy ricotta, and crispy topping makes for a versatile dish that's perfect for any occasion. Whether you're hosting a dinner party or looking for a comforting family meal, this recipe delivers both flavor and satisfaction. It's also a great way to use up abundant summer zucchini while creating something truly memorable.



## FAQ


### Can I make this dish ahead of time?

You can assemble the entire dish up to 24 hours in advance and store it covered in the refrigerator. When ready to bake, let it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes before putting it in the oven. You might need to add 5-10 minutes to the covered baking time.



### Can I freeze Zucchini Ricotta Bake?

While it's possible to freeze this dish, the texture of the zucchini may change slightly upon thawing. If you decide to freeze it, do so before baking. Wrap it well in foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw completely in the refrigerator before baking according to the original instructions.



### What can I serve with this dish?

This versatile dish pairs wonderfully with a crisp green salad, crusty bread, or roasted vegetables. For a complete meal, you can serve it alongside grilled chicken or fish. It's substantial enough to be served as a main vegetarian course as well.
