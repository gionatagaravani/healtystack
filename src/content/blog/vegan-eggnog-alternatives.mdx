Whether you're hosting a holiday gathering or simply craving a festive beverage, these plant-based versions will satisfy your seasonal cravings while keeping things completely dairy-free and egg-free.



## Classic Vegan Nog Recipe




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Cashews (soaked)
    1 cup


    Full-fat coconut milk
    2 cups


    Almond milk
    1 cup


    Medjool dates
    4-5 pieces


    Pure maple syrup
    2 tablespoons


    Vanilla extract
    2 teaspoons


    Nutmeg (freshly grated)
    1 teaspoon


    Cinnamon
    1/2 teaspoon


    Ground cloves
    1/4 teaspoon


    Sea salt
    Pinch





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Cashews

Begin by soaking the cashews in hot water for at least 2 hours, or overnight in cold water. This crucial step ensures a super creamy base for our nog. Drain and rinse thoroughly before use.



### 2. Blend the Base

In a high-speed blender, combine the soaked cashews, coconut milk, and almond milk. Blend on high speed for 2-3 minutes until completely smooth and creamy. This creates the rich, luxurious base that mimics traditional eggnog's texture.



### 3. Add Sweeteners and Flavoring

Add the pitted Medjool dates, maple syrup, vanilla extract, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and salt to the blender. Continue blending until all ingredients are thoroughly combined and the dates are completely broken down, about 1-2 minutes.



### 4. Strain and Chill

For an ultra-smooth consistency, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer or nut milk bag. Transfer to a glass container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the nog to achieve the perfect thickness.



### 5. Serve and Garnish

Before serving, give the nog a good stir as separation is natural. Pour into glasses and garnish with additional freshly grated nutmeg. For a festive touch, add a cinnamon stick stirrer.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make this recipe nut-free?

Yes! You can substitute the cashews with hemp seeds or silken tofu, and replace almond milk with oat milk or coconut milk. The texture might be slightly different, but it will still be delicious.



### Why does my nog separate after sitting?

Separation is natural with homemade plant-based drinks. Simply shake or stir well before serving. To minimize separation, ensure your ingredients are well-blended and consider adding a small amount of sunflower lecithin as an emulsifier.



### Can I reduce the sweetness?

Absolutely! Start with fewer dates or less maple syrup and adjust to taste. You can always add more sweetener, but you can't take it away once it's blended in.
