# The Ultimate Make-Ahead Green Bean Casserole Recipe: A Holiday Time-Saver


Green bean casserole has been a beloved holiday staple since its creation in 1955 by Campbell's Soup Company. This make-ahead version takes the classic comfort dish to new heights while saving precious time during busy celebrations. Perfect for Thanksgiving, Christmas, or any family gathering, this recipe combines fresh green beans, creamy mushroom sauce, and crispy onions in a way that can be prepared days in advance without sacrificing flavor or texture.



## Why Make It Ahead?


The beauty of this make-ahead version lies in its convenience and enhanced flavor profile.

## Step-by-Step Instructions


### Day 1: Initial Preparation


**1. Prepare the Green Beans**


- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil
- Add trimmed green beans and blanch for 5 minutes
- Transfer immediately to an ice bath
- Drain and pat completely dry
- For alternative methods, see [this detailed guide](https://healtystack.com/green-bean-casserole-with-cream-of-mushroom-soup/)

**2. Make the Mushroom Sauce**


- Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat
- Add diced onions and cook until translucent (5-7 minutes)
- Add mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture (8-10 minutes)
- Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute
- Sprinkle flour over the mixture and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly
- Gradually add broth and cream, whisking continuously
- Add thyme, salt, pepper, and nutmeg
- Simmer until sauce thickens (5-7 minutes)
- Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted

**3. Assembly for Storage**


- Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish
- Layer green beans in the dish
- Pour the mushroom sauce evenly over the beans
- Cover tightly with plastic wrap and then aluminum foil
- Refrigerate for up to 48 hours

### Day 2: Baking and Serving


**1. Preheat and Prepare**


- Remove casserole from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking

## Tips for Success


- Pat green beans completely dry before assembling to prevent a watery casserole

- Store fried onions separately until ready to bake
- Ensure even distribution of sauce when assembling
- Allow casserole to come to room temperature before baking

Whether you're hosting a large gathering or contributing to a potluck, this recipe ensures a delicious, crowd-pleasing result every time.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### Q: Can I freeze this casserole?

A: While it's possible to freeze the casserole before adding the crispy onions, I recommend refrigerating instead for the best texture. If you must freeze, thaw completely in the refrigerator before baking and expect slightly softer green beans.



### Q: How long can I keep this in the refrigerator before baking?

A: The assembled casserole (without the crispy onions) can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours before baking. Make sure it's tightly covered with both plastic wrap and foil to maintain freshness.



### Q: Can I use canned green beans instead of fresh?

A: While fresh green beans provide the best texture and flavor, you can use canned green beans in a pinch. If using canned, drain and rinse them well, and skip the blanching step. However, the final texture will be softer than with fresh beans.
