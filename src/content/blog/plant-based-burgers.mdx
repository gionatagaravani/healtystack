# Irresistible Plant-Based Burgers: A Healthy and Delicious Alternative


Plant-based burgers have revolutionized the way we think about traditional hamburgers, offering a sustainable, ethical, and healthier alternative without compromising on taste. These meatless patties are packed with protein, fiber, and essential nutrients, making them an excellent choice for vegans, vegetarians, and anyone looking to reduce their meat consumption. While the market offers numerous pre-made options, creating your own plant-based burgers at home allows you to control the ingredients and customize the flavors to your liking. This recipe yields juicy, flavorful patties that will satisfy even the most dedicated meat lovers.



## Ingredients



    
        Ingredient
        Amount
    
    
        Black beans, drained and rinsed
        2 cans (15 oz each)
    
    
        Cooked quinoa
        1 cup
    
    
        Rolled oats
        1 cup
    
    
        Finely chopped mushrooms
        1 cup
    
    
        Grated carrots
        1/2 cup
    
    
        Diced onion
        1 medium
    
    
        Minced garlic
        3 cloves
    
    
        Ground flaxseed
        2 tablespoons
    
    
        Soy sauce
        2 tablespoons
    
    
        Smoked paprika
        1 tablespoon
    
    
        Ground cumin
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Olive oil
        2 tablespoons
    
    
        Salt
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Black pepper
        1/2 teaspoon
    




## Instructions


### Step 1: Prepare the Flax Egg

Mix the ground flaxseed with 6 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Let it sit for 10 minutes until it becomes gel-like. This mixture will act as a binding agent, similar to eggs in traditional recipes.

### Step 2: Process the Beans

In a food processor, pulse the black beans until they're roughly mashed but not completely smooth. You want to maintain some texture. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.



### Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables

Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until translucent. Add the mushrooms and garlic, cooking for another 5 minutes until the mushrooms release their moisture. Add the grated carrots and cook for 2 more minutes.



### Step 4: Combine Ingredients

Add the sautéed vegetables to the mashed beans. Stir in the cooked quinoa, rolled oats, flax egg, soy sauce, smoked paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly until well combined.

### Step 5: Form the Patties

Divide the mixture into 8 equal portions and shape them into patties about 3/4 inch thick. Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This helps them hold together better during cooking.



### Step 6: Cook the Burgers

Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties for 4-5 minutes on each side until they're golden brown and heated through. Alternatively, you can grill them on a well-oiled grill for the same amount of time.



### Step 7: Serve and Garnish

Serve your plant-based burgers on whole grain buns with your favorite toppings. I recommend lettuce, tomato, avocado, red onion, and a special sauce made from vegan mayo, mustard, and relish. For a complete meal, pair it with a [vegan stir-fry](https://healtystack.com/vegan-stir-fry/) on the side.



## Conclusion

These homemade plant-based burgers are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients and protein. They're perfect for summer barbecues, weeknight dinners, or meal prep. The combination of black beans, quinoa, and vegetables creates a satisfying texture, while the seasonings provide a depth of flavor that rivals any traditional burger. Remember to experiment with different toppings and accompaniments to find your perfect combination.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I freeze these plant-based burgers?

Yes, these burgers freeze exceptionally well! Place uncooked patties on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze until solid. Then transfer them to a freezer bag with parchment paper between each patty. They'll keep for up to 3 months. When ready to cook, thaw in the refrigerator overnight.



### How can I prevent the burgers from falling apart?

The key to keeping these burgers intact is to ensure the right moisture balance and to chill them before cooking. Don't skip the refrigeration step, and make sure to handle them gently while cooking. If the mixture seems too wet, add more oats; if too dry, add a little more soy sauce or olive oil.



### What can I use instead of black beans?

You can substitute black beans with other legumes such as chickpeas, kidney beans, or lentils. Each will provide a slightly different texture and flavor profile, but the recipe will work just as well. Just ensure they're well-drained and mashed to a similar consistency.
