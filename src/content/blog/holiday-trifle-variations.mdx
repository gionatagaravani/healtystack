## FAQ


### How far in advance can I make a holiday trifle?

You can prepare the trifle up to 24 hours in advance. In fact, making it ahead allows the flavors to develop better. Just add any temperature-sensitive garnishes like fresh mint leaves right before serving.



### Can I make individual trifle portions?

Absolutely! Use clear glass cups or mason jars for individual servings. Follow the same layering process but on a smaller scale. This makes for an elegant presentation and easier serving.



### What can I use instead of alcohol in the recipe?

You can substitute the orange liqueur with orange juice, or use other fruit juices that complement your chosen fruits. You can also simply omit it - the trifle will still be delicious!
