# Cheeseburger Quesadillas: The Perfect Fusion of Mexican and American Comfort Food


Imagine combining the savory satisfaction of a juicy cheeseburger with the crispy, cheesy goodness of a quesadilla. That's exactly what you get with these incredible Cheeseburger Quesadillas. This innovative fusion dish brings together the best of both worlds, creating a meal that's both familiar and excitingly different. While I love serving traditional sides like [slow-cooker green bean casserole](https://healtystack.com/slow-cooker-green-bean-casserole/) with my regular burgers, these quesadillas stand perfectly on their own.



## Ingredients



    
        Ingredient
        Amount
    
    
        Ground beef (80/20)
        1 pound
    
    
        Large flour tortillas
        8 (10-inch)
    
    
        Shredded cheddar cheese
        2 cups
    
    
        Diced onion
        1 medium
    
    
        Diced tomatoes
        2 medium
    
    
        Diced pickles
        1/2 cup
    
    
        Yellow mustard
        2 tablespoons
    
    
        Ketchup
        3 tablespoons
    
    
        Worcestershire sauce
        1 tablespoon
    
    
        Garlic powder
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Salt
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Black pepper
        1/2 teaspoon
    
    
        Butter for grilling
        4 tablespoons
    




## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Meat Mixture

Begin by heating a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and break it up with a wooden spoon. Add the diced onions while the meat is still cooking. Cook until the meat is browned and the onions are translucent, about 8-10 minutes. Drain any excess fat.



### 2. Season the Mixture

Add the garlic powder, salt, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and ketchup to the meat mixture. Stir well to combine all ingredients thoroughly. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Just like in a [make-ahead casserole](https://healtystack.com/make-ahead-green-bean-casserole/), these flavors will develop even more as they sit.



### 3. Prepare the Assembly Station

Set up your assembly station with the following items in order:
- Tortillas
- Seasoned meat mixture
- Shredded cheese
- Diced tomatoes
- Diced pickles

### 4. Assemble the Quesadillas

Lay out a tortilla and sprinkle a generous layer of cheese on one half. Add about 1/3 cup of the meat mixture on top of the cheese. Add a sprinkle of diced tomatoes and pickles. Add another layer of cheese on top (this helps the quesadilla stick together). Fold the empty half of the tortilla over the filled half.



### 5. Cook the Quesadillas

Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small pat of butter and let it melt. Place the assembled quesadilla in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until golden brown. Add another small pat of butter to the top of the quesadilla before flipping it. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until both sides are crispy and the cheese is fully melted.



### 6. Final Touches

Remove from heat and let rest for 1 minute before cutting into triangles. This helps the cheese set slightly and prevents it from oozing out immediately. Similar to how we let a [Thanksgiving casserole](https://healtystack.com/thanksgiving-green-bean-casserole/) rest before serving, this brief waiting period makes a difference.



## Conclusion

These Cheeseburger Quesadillas are more than just a novelty fusion dish â€“ they're a legitimate culinary creation that deserves a place in your regular meal rotation. The crispy tortilla provides the perfect vessel for the seasoned ground beef and melted cheese, while the classic burger toppings add familiar flavors and textures. Whether you're looking for a fun twist on Taco Tuesday or just want to switch up your regular burger night, these quesadillas are sure to be a hit with the whole family.



## FAQ


### Can I make these ahead of time?

While the meat mixture can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, I recommend assembling and cooking the quesadillas just before serving. This ensures the tortillas stay crispy and the cheese is perfectly melted.



### What can I serve with Cheeseburger Quesadillas?

These quesadillas pair well with traditional burger sides like french fries or onion rings. You can also serve them with Mexican-inspired sides like guacamole, salsa, or Mexican rice. A simple salad also makes a great accompaniment.



### Can I use different types of cheese?

Absolutely! While I prefer sharp cheddar for its classic cheeseburger flavor, you can experiment with different cheeses or combinations. American cheese, pepper jack, or a Mexican cheese blend would all work well in this recipe.
