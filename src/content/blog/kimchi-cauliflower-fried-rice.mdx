# Kimchi Cauliflower Fried Rice: A Spicy Low-Carb Korean-Inspired Delight


Kimchi Cauliflower Fried Rice is a brilliant fusion dish that combines the gut-healthy properties of kimchi with the low-carb benefits of cauliflower rice. This innovative twist on traditional Korean fried rice delivers all the flavors you love while keeping things light and nutritious. Much like our popular [Vegan Risotto](https://healtystack.com/vegan-risotto/), this dish proves that healthy alternatives can be just as satisfying as their traditional counterparts.



This recipe transforms humble cauliflower into a flavorful, spicy, and satisfying meal that's perfect for busy weeknights or meal prep. The combination of fermented kimchi, fresh vegetables, and aromatic seasonings creates a complex flavor profile that will make you forget you're eating cauliflower instead of rice.



## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Cauliflower head
    1 large (about 2 pounds)


    Kimchi
    1 cup, chopped


    Kimchi juice
    2 tablespoons


    Carrots
    2 medium, diced


    Green onions
    4, sliced


    Garlic
    4 cloves, minced


    Ginger
    1 tablespoon, grated


    Sesame oil
    2 tablespoons


    Soy sauce
    3 tablespoons


    Gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes)
    1 teaspoon (optional)


    Tofu
    14 oz, firm, cubed


    Sesame seeds
    2 tablespoons





## Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Cauliflower Rice

Cut the cauliflower into florets and pulse in a food processor until it reaches a rice-like consistency. Work in batches if necessary. Be careful not to over-process, or it will become mushy. If you don't have a food processor, you can use a box grater.



### 2. Prep the Ingredients

Chop all vegetables and ingredients before starting to cook. This ensures smooth cooking process, similar to how we prepare ingredients for our [Healthy Vegan Pizza](https://healtystack.com/healthy-vegan-pizza/).



### 3. Cook the Tofu

Heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cubed tofu and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.



### 4. Sauté the Aromatics

In the same pan, add the remaining sesame oil. Add minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add diced carrots and cook for 2-3 minutes.



### 5. Cook the Cauliflower Rice

Add the cauliflower rice to the pan. Stir-fry for 5-6 minutes until the cauliflower is slightly tender but still maintains some crunch. Don't overcook, as it can become mushy.



### 6. Add Kimchi and Seasonings

Add the chopped kimchi, kimchi juice, and soy sauce. Stir well to combine. If using gochugaru, add it now. This spicy kick is similar to what we use in our [Plant-Based Tacos](https://healtystack.com/plant-based-tacos/).



### 7. Final Steps

Return the tofu to the pan. Add half of the green onions and cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.



### 8. Serve

Transfer to serving bowls. Garnish with remaining green onions and sesame seeds. Serve hot.



## Conclusion

This Kimchi Cauliflower Fried Rice is a perfect example of how healthy cooking can be both nutritious and delicious. It's packed with probiotics from the kimchi, fiber from the cauliflower, and protein from the tofu. Whether you're following a low-carb diet or simply looking to add more vegetables to your meals, this dish delivers on all fronts. The combination of Korean flavors with cauliflower rice creates a unique fusion dish that's sure to become a regular in your meal rotation.



## FAQ


### Can I make this recipe ahead of time?

You can prepare the cauliflower rice up to 3 days in advance and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. The complete dish can be stored for up to 4 days in the refrigerator, although the cauliflower might release some water when reheated.



### Is this recipe suitable for vegetarians and vegans?

Yes, this recipe is completely plant-based and suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. Just ensure your kimchi is vegan, as traditional kimchi sometimes contains fish sauce or shrimp paste.



### Can I make this less spicy?

Absolutely! You can control the spice level by using mild kimchi and omitting the gochugaru. You can also add a touch of maple syrup or mirin to balance the heat if needed.
