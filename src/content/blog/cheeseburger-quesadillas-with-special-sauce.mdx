## Instructions


### Step 1: Prepare the Special Sauce

In a medium bowl, combine mayonnaise, ketchup, pickle relish, mustard, vinegar, paprika, and onion powder. Whisk until well combined and smooth. Cover and refrigerate while preparing the rest of the ingredients. This sauce, much like the cream sauce in a [classic green bean casserole](https://healtystack.com/green-bean-casserole-with-cream-of-mushroom-soup/), will tie all the flavors together perfectly.



### Step 2: Cook the Ground Beef

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add the ground beef, breaking it up with a wooden spoon.
3. Add salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
4. Cook until beef is browned and no longer pink (about 8-10 minutes).
5. Drain excess fat and set aside.

### Step 3: Prepare the Filling

1. Dice the onions and tomatoes.
2. Shred the lettuce.
3. Slice the pickles if not pre-sliced.
4. Have all ingredients ready for assembly, similar to how you'd prep ingredients for a [crispy topped casserole](https://healtystack.com/green-bean-casserole-with-crispy-onions/).

### Step 4: Assemble the Quesadillas

1. Lay out a tortilla on a clean work surface.
2. Sprinkle a generous layer of shredded cheese on one half of the tortilla.
3. Add a portion of the cooked ground beef.
4. Top with diced onions, tomatoes, pickles, and shredded lettuce.
5. Drizzle with special sauce.
6. Add another layer of cheese (this helps hold everything together).
7. Fold the empty half over the filled half.

### Step 5: Cook the Quesadillas

1. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat.
2. Add 1/2 tablespoon butter and let it melt.
3. Carefully place the assembled quesadilla in the pan.
4. Cook for 2-3 minutes until golden brown and crispy.
5. Add another small pat of butter to the pan and flip the quesadilla.
6. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until both sides are golden brown and cheese is fully melted.
7. Remove from heat and let rest for 1 minute.

### Step 6: Serve

1. Cut each quesadilla into triangles.
2. Serve immediately with extra special sauce on the side.
3. Garnish with additional lettuce, tomatoes, or pickles if desired.

## FAQ


### Can I make these quesadillas ahead of time?

While it's best to serve quesadillas fresh off the griddle, you can prepare the components ahead of time. Cook the ground beef, mix the special sauce, and prep the vegetables up to a day in advance. Store everything separately in the refrigerator, then assemble and cook the quesadillas when you're ready to eat.



### Can I use a different type of cheese?

Absolutely! While sharp cheddar provides that classic cheeseburger taste, you can experiment with different cheeses. Try a mixture of cheddar and Monterey Jack for extra meltiness, or use American cheese for that authentic fast-food burger flavor. Just make sure to use a cheese that melts well.



### Is there a way to make these healthier?

Yes, you can make several modifications to reduce calories. Use lean ground beef or ground turkey, whole wheat tortillas, reduced-fat cheese, and light mayonnaise in the special sauce. You can also increase the vegetables and reduce the meat portion to make them lighter.
