## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Fresh salmon fillets
    4 pieces (6 oz each)


    Ripe avocados
    2 medium


    Red onion
    1/2 cup, finely diced


    Cherry tomatoes
    1 cup, quartered


    Fresh cilantro
    1/4 cup, chopped


    Lime juice
    2 tablespoons


    Olive oil
    3 tablespoons


    Garlic powder
    1 teaspoon


    Sea salt
    1 teaspoon


    Black pepper
    1/2 teaspoon


    Jalapeño pepper (optional)
    1 small, seeded and minced





## Instructions


### Preparing the Salmon


1. Remove the salmon fillets from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature. This ensures even cooking.



2. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. This helps achieve a better sear when grilling.



3. In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of olive oil, garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.



4. Brush the salmon fillets generously with the seasoned oil mixture on both sides.



### Making the Avocado Salsa


5. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pit, and dice into small cubes.



6. In a medium bowl, combine the diced avocados, red onion, cherry tomatoes, and cilantro. If you're looking for other creative ways to use avocados, check out our [Zucchini Ricotta Bake](https://healtystack.com/zucchini-ricotta-bake/) recipe.



7. Add lime juice, remaining olive oil, salt, and pepper. If using, add the minced jalapeño.



8. Gently toss all ingredients together, being careful not to mash the avocados. Set aside to let the flavors meld.



### Grilling the Salmon


9. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 375-400°F). Clean and oil the grates to prevent sticking.



10. Place the salmon fillets on the grill, skin-side up. Close the lid and grill for 4-5 minutes.



11. Carefully flip the salmon using a wide spatula. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through but still slightly pink in the center.



12. The salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork and has reached an internal temperature of 145°F.



### Serving


13. Transfer the grilled salmon to serving plates.



14. Top each fillet generously with the avocado salsa.



15. Serve immediately with extra lime wedges and cilantro for garnish.

## FAQ


### Can I make the avocado salsa ahead of time?

The avocado salsa is best made fresh, but you can prepare it up to 2 hours in advance. To prevent browning, press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the salsa and refrigerate. The lime juice will help maintain the avocado's color.



### What's the best type of salmon to use for this recipe?

Wild-caught salmon varieties like Sockeye or King salmon work best for grilling due to their firm texture and rich flavor. However, farm-raised salmon will also work well. Choose fresh salmon with bright color and firm flesh.



### Can I cook the salmon in the oven instead of grilling?

Yes, you can bake the salmon in a preheated 400°F oven for 12-15 minutes, or until it flakes easily with a fork. You'll miss the smoky flavor from grilling, but the dish will still be delicious.
