## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    All-purpose flour
    2 cups


    Baking powder
    2 tablespoons


    Sugar
    3 tablespoons


    Salt
    1/2 teaspoon


    Plant-based milk (soy, almond, or oat)
    2 cups


    Apple cider vinegar
    2 teaspoons


    Vanilla extract
    1 teaspoon


    Vegetable oil
    3 tablespoons





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Vegan Buttermilk

Begin by combining the plant-based milk with apple cider vinegar in a medium bowl. Let this mixture sit for about 5-10 minutes until it slightly curdles, creating a vegan buttermilk. This process is crucial for achieving that classic pancake tang and texture.



### 2. Mix Dry Ingredients

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Make sure to break up any lumps in the flour for a smooth batter. The baking powder is key to achieving those fluffy, light pancakes we're aiming for.



### 3. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients

Add the vanilla extract and vegetable oil to your vegan buttermilk mixture. Then, pour these wet ingredients into the bowl with your dry ingredients. Gently whisk everything together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix – some small lumps are perfectly fine and actually desirable for tender pancakes.



### 4. Rest the Batter

Let the batter rest for about 5 minutes. This allows the flour to properly hydrate and the baking powder to activate, resulting in fluffier pancakes. During this time, you can prepare your cooking surface and gather your toppings.

### 5. Cook the Pancakes

Heat a non-stick griddle or pan over medium heat. Once hot, lightly grease with a small amount of oil or vegan butter. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges start to look dry (about 2-3 minutes). Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.



### 6. Keep Warm and Serve

Place cooked pancakes on a plate in a warm oven (around 200°F/95°C) while you finish cooking the remaining batter. This ensures everyone gets to enjoy warm pancakes together.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make the batter ahead of time?

While it's best to make the batter fresh, you can prepare it up to one hour in advance and keep it at room temperature. If you need to store it longer, cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours, though you may need to thin it slightly with a splash of plant milk before cooking.



### Why are my pancakes not fluffy?

The key to fluffy pancakes lies in the baking powder and not overmixing the batter. Make sure your baking powder is fresh and active. Also, letting the batter rest for 5 minutes before cooking allows the leavening agents to work their magic. Finally, ensure your cooking surface is at the right temperature – too hot or too cool can affect the rise.



### Can I freeze these pancakes?

Absolutely! Let them cool completely, then place parchment paper between each pancake and store in an airtight container or freezer bag for up to 3 months. Reheat in a toaster or microwave when ready to enjoy.
