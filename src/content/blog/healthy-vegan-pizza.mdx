## Ingredients



    
        Ingredient
        Amount
    
    
        Whole wheat flour
        2 cups
    
    
        Active dry yeast
        2¼ teaspoons
    
    
        Warm water
        1 cup
    
    
        Maple syrup
        1 tablespoon
    
    
        Salt
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Olive oil
        2 tablespoons
    
    
        Crushed tomatoes
        1 can (14 oz)
    
    
        Garlic powder
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Italian herbs
        1 tablespoon
    
    
        Cashew cheese
        1 cup
    
    
        Bell peppers
        2 medium
    
    
        Mushrooms
        1 cup, sliced
    
    
        Fresh spinach
        2 cups
    
    
        Red onion
        1 medium
    




## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Preparing the Dough

In a large bowl, combine warm water and maple syrup. Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture and let it sit for 10 minutes until foamy. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, mix the whole wheat flour and salt. Once the yeast is activated, add the olive oil to the wet ingredients, then gradually incorporate the flour mixture. Knead for 8-10 minutes until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 hour.



### 2. Making the Sauce

While the dough rises, prepare your sauce by combining crushed tomatoes, garlic powder, and Italian herbs in a bowl. This fresh sauce brings more flavor than store-bought alternatives, similar to the rich taste profile in our [vegan chili recipes](https://healtystack.com/vegan-chili-recipes/).



### 3. Preparing Toppings

Slice bell peppers and red onion into thin strips. Clean and slice mushrooms. Wash spinach leaves thoroughly. If making homemade cashew cheese, blend soaked cashews with nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and seasonings until smooth.



### 4. Assembling the Pizza

Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer to a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread the tomato sauce evenly, leaving a small border for the crust. Layer your vegetables and dollop with cashew cheese.



### 5. Baking

Bake for 15-20 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the vegetables are roasted. The cashew cheese should be slightly melted and bubbly.



## Conclusion

This healthy vegan pizza proves that plant-based eating doesn't mean giving up your favorite foods. It's packed with nutrients, fiber, and protein, making it a satisfying meal that you can feel good about eating. Just like our popular [vegan pancakes](https://healtystack.com/vegan-pancakes/), this recipe shows how creative we can get with plant-based alternatives while maintaining the essence of classic dishes.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I prepare the dough in advance?

Yes, you can prepare the dough up to 24 hours in advance. After kneading, place it in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator. Let it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes before rolling out.



### What can I use instead of cashew cheese?

There are several alternatives to cashew cheese, including store-bought vegan mozzarella, homemade almond cheese, or a nutritional yeast-based cheese sauce. You can also skip the cheese altogether and add extra vegetables or a drizzle of herb-infused olive oil.



### How can I make the crust crispier?

For a crispier crust, pre-bake the rolled-out dough for 5 minutes before adding toppings. Using a pizza stone and preheating it in the oven will also help achieve a crispier bottom crust.
