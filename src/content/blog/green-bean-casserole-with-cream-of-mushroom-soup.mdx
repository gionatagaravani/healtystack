# The Ultimate Green Bean Casserole with Cream of Mushroom Soup Recipe


Green bean casserole is a beloved classic that has graced holiday tables and family gatherings for generations. This timeless dish, first created by Campbell's Soup Company in 1955, combines fresh green beans, cream of mushroom soup, and crispy fried onions into a harmonious blend of flavors and textures. While the [traditional recipe](https://healtystack.com/easy-green-bean-casserole-recipe/) remains a favorite, this enhanced version elevates the dish with additional ingredients and techniques that make it even more delicious.



## Ingredients


    
        Ingredient
        Amount
    
    
        Fresh green beans, trimmed
        2 pounds
    
    
        Cream of mushroom soup
        2 (10.5 oz) cans
    
    
        Fresh mushrooms, sliced
        8 ounces
    
    
        French's crispy fried onions
        1½ cups
    
    
        Heavy cream
        ½ cup
    
    
        Garlic, minced
        3 cloves
    
    
        Butter
        2 tablespoons
    
    
        Worcestershire sauce
        1 tablespoon
    
    
        Salt
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Black pepper
        ½ teaspoon
    
    
        Grated Parmesan cheese
        ½ cup
    




## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Green Beans

Start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the trimmed green beans and blanch them for 5 minutes until they're bright green and slightly tender but still crisp. Immediately transfer them to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. This step ensures your green beans maintain their vibrant color and perfect texture, similar to the technique used in this [crispy onion version](https://healtystack.com/green-bean-casserole-with-crispy-onions/).



### 2. Sauté the Mushrooms

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and become golden brown, approximately 8-10 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.



### 3. Create the Sauce

In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream of mushroom soup, heavy cream, Worcestershire sauce, remaining salt, and pepper. Mix well until smooth. Add the sautéed mushrooms and garlic mixture, stirring to combine. This creamy base is what makes the casserole so irresistible, similar to the richness found in this [comforting soup recipe](https://healtystack.com/chicken-soup-with-butternut-squash/).



## Conclusion

This enhanced green bean casserole takes a beloved classic to new heights while maintaining its nostalgic charm. The combination of fresh ingredients, proper technique, and careful attention to detail results in a dish that's worthy of any special occasion but simple enough for everyday enjoyment.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make this casserole ahead of time?

Yes! You can assemble the casserole up to 24 hours in advance, excluding the crispy onion topping. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. When ready to bake, remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking, add the onions, and bake as directed.



### Can I use frozen green beans instead of fresh?

While fresh green beans provide the best texture, you can use frozen green beans in a pinch. Thaw them completely and pat dry before using. Avoid canned green beans as they tend to become mushy during baking.
