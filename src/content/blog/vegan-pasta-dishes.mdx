    Extra virgin olive oil
    1/3 cup


    Garlic cloves
    6-8 cloves


    Cashews (raw)

    Sun-dried tomatoes

    Black pepper

## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Preparation (30 minutes)

Begin by soaking the cashews in hot water for at least 30 minutes. This will ensure a creamy sauce texture. While waiting, chop all vegetables and prepare your mise en place. Similar to preparing for [holiday main dishes](https://healtystack.com/plant-based-holiday-main-dishes/), organization is key.



### 2. Basic Cashew Cream Sauce (15 minutes)

Drain the soaked cashews and blend them with:
- 1 cup plant-based milk
- 2 cloves minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- Salt and pepper to taste
Blend until completely smooth and set aside.

### 3. Cooking the Pasta (10-12 minutes)

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook pasta according to package instructions, but remove 1 minute before recommended time for al dente texture. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.



### 4. Preparing the Base Sauce (15 minutes)

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add:
- 4 cloves minced garlic
- Red pepper flakes
- Halved cherry tomatoes
Saut√© until tomatoes begin to burst, about 5-7 minutes.

### 5. Combining Components (10 minutes)

Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with tomatoes. Pour in the cashew cream sauce and add:
- Spinach
- Sun-dried tomatoes
- 1/2 cup pasta water (add more if needed)
Toss everything together until well combined and spinach wilts.

### 6. Final Touches (5 minutes)

Finish the dish with:
- Fresh basil leaves
- Additional nutritional yeast
- Adjust seasoning to taste
Let sit for 2-3 minutes before serving to allow sauce to thicken.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### How can I make my vegan pasta dishes more protein-rich?

You can boost protein content by adding chickpeas, lentils, or other legumes to your pasta dishes. Nutritional yeast also adds protein while providing a cheese-like flavor. Additionally, choosing pasta made from legumes (like chickpea or lentil pasta) naturally increases the protein content.



### Can I prepare these vegan pasta dishes in advance?

Most vegan pasta dishes can be prepared ahead and stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. However, I recommend slightly undercooking the pasta if you plan to reheat it later. When reheating, add a splash of plant-based milk or pasta water to refresh the sauce.



### What are the best pasta types for vegan dishes?

While most dried pasta is naturally vegan, I recommend whole grain, legume-based, or vegetable-based pasta for added nutrition. These alternatives provide extra fiber, protein, and nutrients compared to regular white pasta. Just be sure to check the ingredient list as some fresh pasta may contain eggs.
