## FAQ


### How long can I store my smoothies?

While smoothies are best consumed immediately, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Add a squeeze of lemon juice to prevent oxidation and give them a good shake before drinking.



### Can I meal prep smoothies?

Yes! Prepare smoothie bags by portioning out your ingredients (except liquids) into freezer bags. When ready to make your smoothie, simply empty the bag into your blender, add liquid, and blend.



### How can I make my smoothies more filling?

Add healthy fats and protein like nut butters, seeds, or plant-based protein powder. Also, including fiber-rich ingredients like oats or chia seeds will help keep you satisfied longer.
