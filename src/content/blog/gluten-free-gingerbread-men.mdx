## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Gluten-free all-purpose flour blend
    3 cups


    Almond flour
    1 cup


    Ground ginger
    2 tablespoons


    Ground cinnamon
    2 teaspoons


    Ground nutmeg
    1/2 teaspoon


    Ground cloves
    1/2 teaspoon


    Baking soda
    1 teaspoon


    Salt
    1/4 teaspoon


    Butter (softened)
    3/4 cup


    Dark brown sugar
    3/4 cup


    Molasses
    1/2 cup


    Large egg
    1


    Vanilla extract
    1 teaspoon


    Xanthan gum (if your flour blend doesn't include it)
    1 teaspoon





## Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Dry Ingredients

In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, [almond flour](https://healtystack.com/almond-flour-christmas-cookies/), ground ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, baking soda, and salt. If your gluten-free flour blend doesn't contain xanthan gum, add it now. Whisk everything together until well combined and set aside.



### 2. Create the Wet Mixture

In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and brown sugar using an electric mixer on medium speed for about 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the molasses and continue mixing until well incorporated. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until smooth.



### 3. Combine the Mixtures

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed after each addition. Continue until all ingredients are well combined and a soft dough forms. The dough will be slightly sticky.



### 4. Chill the Dough

Divide the dough into two portions and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. This step is crucial for easier handling and better-shaped cookies.



### 5. Prepare for Baking

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line several baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove one portion of dough from the refrigerator, keeping the other chilled until needed.



### 6. Roll and Cut

Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll to about 1/4 inch thickness. Remove the top parchment and cut out gingerbread men shapes using your cookie cutter. Carefully transfer the cutouts to the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie.



### 7. Bake the Cookies

Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned and the centers appear set. Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.



### 8. Decorate

Once completely cooled, decorate your gingerbread men with gluten-free royal icing, candies, or other gluten-free decorations. Get creative with different designs and patterns!



## Conclusion

These gluten-free gingerbread men are proof that dietary restrictions don't mean missing out on holiday traditions. With their perfect blend of spices and ideal texture, they're every bit as delicious as their traditional counterparts. Whether you're serving them alongside other holiday treats like a [glazed Christmas ham](https://healtystack.com/classic-ham-glaze-recipe/) or packaging them as gifts, these cookies are sure to bring joy to everyone who tries them. Remember to store them in an airtight container, where they'll keep fresh for up to a week.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I freeze these gluten-free gingerbread men?

Yes! You can freeze these cookies both before and after baking. The unbaked dough can be frozen for up to 3 months when wrapped properly. Baked cookies can be frozen for up to 2 months in an airtight container. Just make sure to decorate them after thawing if you're freezing baked cookies.



### Why did my cookies spread too much during baking?

If your cookies are spreading too much, it's likely because the dough wasn't chilled enough. Make sure to refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours, and work with cold dough. Also, check that your oven temperature is accurate, as an oven that's too hot can cause spreading.



### Can I make these dairy-free as well?

Yes, you can substitute the butter with dairy-free alternatives like coconut oil or dairy-free margarine. Just make sure your replacement is solid at room temperature for the best results. You might need to adjust the chilling time slightly when using alternatives.
