## Ingredients





    
        Ingredient
        Amount
    
    
        Mixed dried fruits (raisins, currants, cranberries)
        3 cups
    
    
        Candied citrus peel
        1 cup
    
    
        All-purpose flour
        2½ cups
    
    
        Unsalted butter
        1 cup
    
    
        Dark brown sugar
        1 cup
    
    
        Eggs
        4 large
    
    
        Brandy or rum
        ½ cup
    
    
        Ground cinnamon
        2 teaspoons
    
    
        Ground nutmeg
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Ground allspice
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Ground ginger
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Baking powder
        1 teaspoon
    
    
        Salt
        ½ teaspoon
    




## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Fruit Preparation (Day Before)

Begin by soaking your dried fruits in brandy or rum overnight. This crucial step ensures moist, flavorful fruits that will distribute beautifully throughout your cake. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 12-24 hours.



### 2. Preparation

Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Line a 9-inch round cake pan with double-thickness parchment paper, ensuring the paper extends 2 inches above the rim. This extra height helps prevent over-browning during the long baking process.



### 3. Mixing Dry Ingredients

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, spices, baking powder, and salt. The combination of spices is crucial for that traditional holiday flavor, similar to the warming spices used in our [holiday dessert recipes](https://healtystack.com/quick-peppermint-fudge/).



### 4. Creaming

Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, cream the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy (about 5 minutes). This step is crucial for achieving the right texture in your final cake.



### 5. Adding Eggs

Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the bowl's sides as needed to ensure even mixing.



### 6. Combining Wet and Dry

Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with any remaining soaking liquid from the fruits. Mix until just combined to avoid overworking the batter.



### 7. Adding Fruits

Fold in the soaked fruits gently using a spatula. This ensures even distribution without breaking down the fruits.



### 8. Baking

Pour the batter into your prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Tap the pan gently on the counter to remove air bubbles.



### 9. Perfect Timing

Bake for approximately 2-2½ hours, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. The top should be deep golden brown.



### Variation Options:

1. Tropical Twist: Replace traditional dried fruits with dried mango, pineapple, and papaya.
2. Mediterranean Style: Use figs, dates, and pistachios instead of traditional fruits.
3. Chocolate Infusion: Add ½ cup of dark chocolate chips and reduce sugar by ¼ cup.

## Conclusion

This spiced fruitcake recipe offers a perfect balance of traditional flavors with modern variations. Whether you're serving it alongside other [holiday dishes](https://healtystack.com/plant-based-holiday-main-dishes/) or giving it as a gift, these variations ensure there's a version for everyone's taste. Remember, like fine wine, this cake gets better with age, making it perfect for preparing well in advance of the holiday season.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### How long will this fruitcake keep?

When stored properly in an airtight container and occasionally brushed with brandy or rum, this fruitcake can last up to 3 months at room temperature or 6 months in the refrigerator.



### Can I make this recipe alcohol-free?

Yes! Simply replace the brandy/rum with an equal amount of orange juice or apple juice. The cake won't keep as long but will still be delicious.



### Why does my fruitcake sometimes sink in the middle?

This usually happens when the oven door is opened too often during baking or if the oven temperature is too high. Keep the door closed for the first 2 hours of baking and ensure your oven is correctly calibrated.
