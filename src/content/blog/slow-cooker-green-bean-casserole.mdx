    Amount


    Fresh green beans, trimmed
    2 pounds


    Cream of mushroom soup
    2 (10.5 oz) cans


    Fresh mushrooms, sliced
    8 ounces


    French-fried onions
    2 cups


    Heavy cream
    1 cup


    Garlic, minced
    3 cloves


    Soy sauce
    2 tablespoons


    Black pepper, freshly ground
    1 teaspoon

## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Preparation Phase

Begin by properly cleaning and preparing your slow cooker. Lightly grease the interior with cooking spray or butter to prevent sticking. This step is crucial for easy serving and cleanup later.



### 2. Green Bean Preparation

Thoroughly wash the fresh green beans and trim off the ends. If the beans are particularly long, cut them into 2-inch pieces. This size ensures even cooking and makes the casserole easier to serve and eat.

- Both cans of cream of mushroom soup
- Heavy cream
- Minced garlic
- Soy sauce
- Worcestershire sauce
- Black pepper
- Salt
- Onion powder
Whisk these ingredients together until well combined and smooth.

### 4. Mushroom Preparation

In a skillet over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté until they're golden brown and have released their moisture, approximately 5-7 minutes. This step adds an extra layer of mushroom flavor to complement the cream of mushroom soup.



### 5. Layering the Ingredients

Now it's time to layer the ingredients in your slow cooker:
1. Place half of the green beans in the bottom
2. Pour half of the cream mixture over the beans
3. Add half of the sautéed mushrooms
4. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese
5. Repeat these layers with remaining ingredients

### 6. Slow Cooking Process

Cover the slow cooker and set it to:
- LOW: Cook for 5-6 hours
- HIGH: Cook for 2-3 hours
The green beans should be tender but still maintain their shape. For additional recipe variations, you might want to check out this [cream of mushroom soup version](https://healtystack.com/green-bean-casserole-with-cream-of-mushroom-soup/).

2. Sprinkle the remaining cup of French-fried onions on top
3. Replace the lid and continue cooking

## FAQ


### Can I prepare this recipe ahead of time?

Yes, you can prepare all the components up to 24 hours in advance. Store the cream mixture and prepared green beans separately in the refrigerator. Combine them in the slow cooker when you're ready to cook. However, wait to add the French-fried onions until the final 15 minutes of cooking to maintain their crispiness.



### Can I use frozen green beans instead of fresh?

Yes, frozen green beans can be used as a substitute for fresh ones. Thaw them completely and pat them dry before using to prevent excess water from diluting the sauce. You may need to reduce the cooking time by 30-60 minutes as frozen green beans are partially cooked.
