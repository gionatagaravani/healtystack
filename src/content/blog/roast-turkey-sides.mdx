## Frequently Asked Questions


### How far in advance can I prepare these side dishes?

Many sides can be prepared 1-2 days in advance. Mashed potatoes can be made the day before and reheated with extra butter and cream. Cranberry sauce can be made up to a week ahead. Stuffing can be assembled the day before and baked just before serving.



### How do I keep all the side dishes warm while the turkey rests?

Cover dishes with foil and place in a low-temperature oven (170-200°F). Alternatively, use slow cookers or chafing dishes for buffet-style serving. Rotate dishes in and out of the oven as needed.



### What's the best way to reheat leftover side dishes?

Most sides can be reheated in the microwave or oven. For mashed potatoes, add a splash of cream or milk while reheating. Stuffing and casseroles should be covered with foil and heated in the oven at 350°F until warm throughout.
