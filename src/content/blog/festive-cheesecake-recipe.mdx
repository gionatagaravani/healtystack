## Ingredients


    
        Ingredient
        Amount
    
    
        Graham crackers, crushed
        2 cups
    
    
        Melted butter
        1/2 cup
    
    
        Cream cheese, room temperature
        32 oz (4 packages)
    
    
        Granulated sugar
        1 1/4 cups
    
    
        Eggs
        4 large
    
    
        Heavy cream
        1/3 cup
    
    
        Vanilla extract
        2 teaspoons
    
    
        Peppermint extract
        1/2 teaspoon
    
    
        White chocolate, chopped
        6 oz
    
    
        Fresh cranberries
        1 cup
    
    
        Rosemary sprigs
        4-5 small
    
    
        Powdered sugar
        1/4 cup
    




## Instructions


### Crust Preparation

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with aluminum foil to prevent water seepage during baking.



2. Mix the crushed graham crackers with melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of the prepared pan.



3. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove and let cool while preparing the filling.



### Cheesecake Filling

4. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy using an electric mixer.



5. Gradually add the sugar, beating until well combined. Similar to making [holiday cookies](https://healtystack.com/chocolate-chip-holiday-cookies/), proper sugar incorporation is crucial for texture.



6. Add eggs one at a time, beating on low speed after each addition just until blended.



7. Stir in heavy cream, vanilla extract, and peppermint extract.



8. Fold in melted and slightly cooled white chocolate.



### Baking Process

9. Pour the filling into the prepared crust.



10. Place the springform pan in a larger roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with hot water about halfway up the sides of the springform pan.



11. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the center is almost set but still slightly jiggly.



12. Turn off the oven, crack the door open, and let the cheesecake cool in the oven for 1 hour.



### Decoration and Finishing

13. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.



14. Before serving, prepare the cranberry topping. Similar to creating a [holiday trifle](https://healtystack.com/holiday-trifle-variations/), the decorative elements add both visual appeal and flavor.



15. Arrange fresh cranberries and rosemary sprigs on top, dust with powdered sugar for a snowy effect.



## Conclusion

This festive cheesecake is more than just a dessert; it's a celebration centerpiece that combines classic cheesecake richness with holiday flair. The contrast between the creamy filling, tart cranberries, and hint of peppermint creates a sophisticated flavor profile that's perfect for special occasions. While it requires some time and patience to prepare, the end result is well worth the effort.



## FAQ


### Can I make this cheesecake ahead of time?

You can make this cheesecake up to 3 days in advance. Store it in the refrigerator, covered loosely with plastic wrap. Add the decorative toppings just before serving to maintain their fresh appearance.



### Why did my cheesecake crack, and how can I prevent this?

Cheesecakes typically crack due to sudden temperature changes or overbeating the batter. To prevent cracks, ensure all ingredients are at room temperature before starting, don't overbeat the mixture after adding the eggs, use a water bath while baking, and allow the cheesecake to cool gradually in the oven.



### Can I freeze this festive cheesecake?

Yes, you can freeze the cheesecake for up to 2 months. Wrap it well in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, omitting the decorative toppings. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and add fresh toppings before serving.
