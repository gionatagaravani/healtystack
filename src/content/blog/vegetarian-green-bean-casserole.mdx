## Ingredients



    
        Ingredient
        Amount
    
    
        Fresh green beans, trimmed
        2 pounds
    
    
        Cremini mushrooms, sliced
        16 ounces
    
    
        Yellow onion, diced
        1 medium
    
    
        Garlic cloves, minced
        4 cloves
    
    
        Plant-based milk (unsweetened)
        2 cups
    
    
        Vegetable broth
        1 cup
    
    
        All-purpose flour
        1/3 cup
    
    
        Nutritional yeast
        2 tablespoons
    
    
        Olive oil
        3 tablespoons
    
    
        French-fried onions
        1½ cups
    
    
        Fresh thyme
        2 sprigs
    
    
        Salt
        1½ teaspoons
    
    
        Black pepper
        ½ teaspoon
    




## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Green Beans

Begin by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the trimmed green beans and blanch for 5 minutes until bright green and crisp-tender. Immediately transfer to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Drain well and set aside. This step can be done up to 24 hours in advance, making it perfect for [make-ahead preparation](https://healtystack.com/make-ahead-green-bean-casserole/).



### 2. Create the Mushroom Base

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 8-10 minutes. Add the diced onion and cook for another 5 minutes until softened. Stir in the minced garlic and fresh thyme leaves, cooking for an additional minute until fragrant.



### 3. Make the Creamy Sauce

Push the mushroom mixture to one side of the pan and add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the empty side. Sprinkle the flour over the oil and whisk to create a roux, cooking for 1-2 minutes. Gradually pour in the vegetable broth and plant-based milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Combine with the mushroom mixture and add nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 5-7 minutes until thickened.



### 4. Combine and Bake

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Combine the blanched green beans with the mushroom sauce in a 9x13 inch baking dish. For those who prefer a [slow-cooker version](https://healtystack.com/slow-cooker-green-bean-casserole/), this can be adapted accordingly. Top with 1 cup of French-fried onions and bake for 25 minutes until bubbly.



### 5. Final Touch

Add the remaining ½ cup of French-fried onions and bake for an additional 5 minutes until golden brown and crispy. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.



## Conclusion

This vegetarian green bean casserole proves that plant-based cooking can be just as rich and satisfying as traditional recipes. The homemade mushroom sauce provides depth and complexity that canned soup simply can't match, while the combination of fresh vegetables and crispy onions creates a delightful contrast of textures. Whether served at a holiday gathering or a casual family dinner, this dish is sure to become a new favorite.

Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, place in a 350°F (175°C) oven for 15-20 minutes until heated through. Note that the crispy onion topping may lose some crunchiness during storage.
