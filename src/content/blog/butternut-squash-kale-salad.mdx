## Ingredients





  
    Ingredient
    Amount
  
  
    Butternut squash, peeled and cubed
    1 medium (about 2 pounds)
  
  
    Kale, stemmed and chopped
    1 large bunch (about 8 cups)
  
  
    Olive oil
    3 tablespoons
  
  
    Salt
    1 teaspoon
  
  
    Black pepper
    1/2 teaspoon
  
  
    Pumpkin seeds
    1/2 cup
  
  
    Dried cranberries
    1/2 cup
  
  
    Red wine vinegar
    2 tablespoons
  
  
    Dijon mustard
    1 tablespoon
  
  
    Honey
    1 tablespoon
  
  
    Garlic clove, minced
    1
  




## Instructions



  - Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).

  - Peel and cube the butternut squash into 1-inch pieces. Place the cubes on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Toss to coat evenly.

  - Roast the butternut squash in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until tender and lightly caramelized. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly.

  - While the squash is roasting, prepare the kale. Remove the tough stems and chop the leaves into bite-sized pieces. Place the chopped kale in a large bowl.

  - In a small skillet, toast the pumpkin seeds over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are lightly golden and fragrant. Remove from heat and set aside.

  - To make the vinaigrette, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper in a small bowl until well combined.

  - Pour the vinaigrette over the chopped kale and massage the dressing into the leaves with your hands for 1-2 minutes. This will help tenderize the kale and infuse it with the flavors of the dressing.

  - Add the roasted butternut squash, toasted pumpkin seeds, and dried cranberries to the kale. Toss gently to combine all the ingredients.

  - Taste the salad and adjust the seasoning if needed, adding more salt, pepper, or vinaigrette to suit your preferences.

  - Serve the butternut squash kale salad immediately, or chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Enjoy!

## Frequently Asked Questions


### 1. Can I make this salad ahead of time?


Yes, you can prepare the components of the salad ahead of time, but it's best to assemble the salad just before serving. You can roast the butternut squash, chop the kale, and prepare the vinaigrette up to a day in advance. Store the components separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator. When you're ready to serve, toss the kale with the vinaigrette, then add the roasted squash, pumpkin seeds, and cranberries.



### 2. Can I substitute other types of squash for the butternut squash?


Absolutely! While butternut squash works beautifully in this recipe, you can also use other types of winter squash, such as acorn squash, kabocha squash, or pumpkin. Just keep in mind that the roasting time may vary slightly depending on the type and size of the squash you choose.



### 3. How can I make this salad vegan-friendly?


To make this salad vegan, simply replace the honey in the vinaigrette with maple syrup or agave nectar. The rest of the ingredients in the recipe are already vegan-friendly, so you can enjoy this delicious and nutritious salad without any further modifications.
