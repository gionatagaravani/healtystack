# How to Cook Perfect Butternut Squash in the Microwave: A Complete Guide


Butternut squash is a versatile fall vegetable that's packed with nutrients, including vitamins A and C, fiber, and potassium. While traditional methods of cooking butternut squash often involve roasting in the oven, which can take 45-60 minutes, the microwave method offers a quick and efficient alternative that doesn't compromise on taste or texture. This convenient cooking method is perfect for busy weeknight meals or when you're craving a healthy side dish without the long wait. The microwave approach reduces cooking time to just about 12-15 minutes while maintaining the squash's natural sweetness and smooth, creamy texture.



## Ingredients Required



    
        Ingredient
        Amount
    
    
        Medium butternut squash
        1 (2-3 pounds)
    
    
        Water
        2-3 tablespoons
    
    
        Salt
        To taste
    
    
        Black pepper
        To taste
    
    
        Butter (optional)
        2 tablespoons
    




## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Preparation

Start by thoroughly washing the exterior of your butternut squash. Even though you won't be eating the skin, it's important to remove any dirt or debris that could contaminate the flesh during cutting. You can learn more about proper vegetable washing techniques on the [FDA's food safety website](https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/selecting-and-serving-produce-safely).



### 2. Cutting the Squash

Using a sharp knife, carefully cut off both ends of the squash. Then, cut the squash in half lengthwise. This creates two long halves that will cook evenly. Exercise extreme caution during this step, as butternut squash can be quite firm and resistant to cutting.



### 3. Seed Removal

Using a spoon, scoop out the seeds and stringy pulp from the cavity of each half. You can save the seeds for roasting later, similar to [pumpkin seeds](https://www.almanac.com/how-roast-pumpkin-seeds-recipe), or discard them.



### 4. Preparing for Microwave

Place the squash halves cut-side down in a microwave-safe dish. Add 2-3 tablespoons of water to the dish, which will create steam and help cook the squash evenly. If your dish doesn't have a lid, cover it with microwave-safe plastic wrap, leaving one corner slightly open for venting.



### 5. Microwaving

Place the dish in the microwave and cook on high power for 10-12 minutes. Cooking time may vary depending on the size of your squash and your microwave's power. The squash is done when you can easily pierce the flesh with a fork.



### 6. Testing for Doneness

After the initial cooking time, carefully check the squash's tenderness by inserting a fork into the thickest part. If it's not tender enough, continue microwaving in 1-minute intervals until desired tenderness is achieved.



### 7. Resting Period

Allow the squash to rest for 5 minutes after microwaving. This helps the temperature equalize and makes it safer to handle. The squash will continue to steam and soften during this time.



### 8. Serving Preparation

Once the squash has cooled slightly, use a spoon to scoop the flesh from the skin. The cooked flesh should separate easily from the outer peel. For a smooth consistency, you can mash the squash with a fork or potato masher.



### 9. Seasoning

Season the cooked squash with salt and pepper to taste. For added richness, you can stir in butter while the squash is still hot. Other seasonings like cinnamon, nutmeg, or brown sugar can be added for variety.



## Conclusion

Microwaving butternut squash is an efficient and effective cooking method that produces tender, flavorful results in a fraction of the time compared to traditional roasting. This technique is perfect for busy weeknights or when you need a quick side dish. The resulting squash can be used in various recipes, from soups to purees, or simply enjoyed on its own with your favorite seasonings.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Q: Can I microwave butternut squash whole?

While it's possible to microwave a whole butternut squash, I don't recommend it. Cutting the squash in half allows for more even cooking and makes it easier to remove the seeds before cooking. Additionally, cooking a whole squash increases the risk of it exploding in the microwave due to pressure buildup.



### Q: How do I store leftover microwaved butternut squash?

I always store leftover cooked butternut squash in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep well for 3-4 days. When reheating, I recommend adding a splash of water and warming it in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval to ensure even heating.



### Q: Can I freeze microwaved butternut squash?

Yes! I frequently freeze cooked butternut squash. Let it cool completely, then place it in freezer-safe containers or bags. Remove as much air as possible to prevent freezer burn. The squash will maintain its quality for up to 3 months in the freezer. When ready to use, thaw overnight in the refrigerator and reheat as needed.
