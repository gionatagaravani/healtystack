# Winter Melon Soup: A Nourishing Asian Delicacy


Winter melon soup is a beloved Asian dish that combines the subtle sweetness of winter melon with savory ingredients to create a deeply nourishing and healing broth. Known for its cooling properties in Traditional Chinese Medicine ([TCM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6567733/)), this soup has been cherished for centuries across East and Southeast Asia. The winter melon, despite its name, is actually harvested in summer and can grow to impressive sizes, sometimes weighing up to 40 pounds. When cooked, it takes on a translucent appearance and absorbs the flavors of the broth beautifully.



## Ingredients

    Winter melon (peeled and cut into chunks)

    Pork ribs or chicken pieces
    1 pound


    Chinese dried scallops (conpoy)
    4-5 pieces


    Dried Chinese mushrooms
    6-8 pieces


    Red dates (jujubes)
    8-10 pieces


    Goji berries
    2 tablespoons


    Fresh ginger (sliced)
    3-4 slices


    Garlic cloves (crushed)
    4 pieces


    Chinese ham (optional)
    2 ounces


    Salt
    To taste


    White pepper
    To taste


    Water
    12 cups





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Preparation (30 minutes)

Begin by preparing all ingredients properly to ensure the best results. This preparation stage is crucial for developing the rich flavors of the soup.




- Soak the dried mushrooms in warm water for 20-30 minutes until soft. Retain the soaking liquid.

- Soak the dried scallops in warm water for 20 minutes.

- Clean the pork ribs or chicken pieces thoroughly under cold running water.

- Peel the winter melon, remove the seeds, and cut into 2-inch chunks.

- Rinse the red dates and goji berries.



### 2. Parboiling the Meat (10 minutes)

This step is essential for achieving a clear, clean-tasting soup.




- Bring a pot of water to a boil.

- Add the pork ribs or chicken pieces.

- Boil for 3-5 minutes until you see scum rising to the surface.

- Drain and rinse the meat under cold water to remove any impurities.



### 3. Making the Soup Base (1 hour)

This is where the foundation of flavors is built. The slow cooking process allows all ingredients to release their essence into the broth.




- In a large soup pot, bring 12 cups of water to a boil.

- Add the parboiled meat, sliced ginger, and crushed garlic.

- Add the soaked scallops and mushrooms, along with their soaking liquid (strained).

- If using Chinese ham, add it now.

- Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 1 hour, skimming any foam that rises to the surface.



### 4. Adding the Winter Melon (30-40 minutes)

Winter melon requires careful timing to achieve the perfect texture - tender but not mushy.




- Add the winter melon chunks to the simmering soup.

- Add the red dates.

- Continue simmering for about 30 minutes, or until the winter melon becomes translucent and tender.

- Add the goji berries in the last 5 minutes of cooking.



### 5. Seasoning (5 minutes)

The final step is crucial for balancing the flavors of your soup.




- Season with salt and white pepper to taste.

- Allow the soup to rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.

- Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.



## Serving Suggestions

Serve this nourishing soup hot in individual bowls. You can garnish with fresh cilantro or green onions if desired. For a complete meal, serve alongside steamed rice and other Chinese dishes. The soup can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Q: Can I make this soup vegetarian?

A: Absolutely! You can skip the meat and use vegetable stock as your base. I recommend adding more mushrooms, some dried seaweed, and vegetarian stock cubes to enhance the umami flavor. The soup will still be delicious and nutritious.



### Q: How do I choose a good winter melon at the store?

A: When selecting a winter melon, I look for one that feels heavy for its size and has a waxy, pale green rind without any soft spots or blemishes. If buying pre-cut pieces, choose ones that are firm and have a pale white flesh. Avoid pieces that appear wet or slimy.



### Q: Can I freeze this soup?

A: Yes, you can freeze winter melon soup, but I recommend freezing it without the melon pieces as they can become mushy when thawed. I suggest cooking the broth base, freezing it, and then adding fresh winter melon when you're ready to serve it. The frozen broth can last up to 3 months in an airtight container.
