## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Fresh green beans, trimmed
    2 pounds


    Button mushrooms, sliced
    1 pound


    Yellow onion, diced
    1 medium


    Garlic cloves, minced
    4


    Heavy cream
    2 cups


    Chicken broth
    1 cup


    All-purpose flour
    1/4 cup


    Butter, unsalted
    4 tablespoons


    French's crispy fried onions
    2 cups


    Grated Parmesan cheese
    1/2 cup


    Fresh thyme leaves
    1 tablespoon


    Salt
    1 1/2 teaspoons


    Black pepper
    1 teaspoon


    Nutmeg, ground
    1/4 teaspoon





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Green Beans

Begin by bringing a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the trimmed green beans and blanch them for 5 minutes until they're bright green and crisp-tender. Immediately transfer them to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. This step ensures your green beans maintain their vibrant color and perfect texture. Drain well and set aside.



### 2. Create the Mushroom Base

In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 8-10 minutes. This process, known as caramelization, develops deep, rich flavors that will enhance your casserole.

### 3. Prepare the Aromatics

Add the diced onion to the mushrooms and cook for another 5 minutes until softened and translucent. Add the minced garlic and fresh thyme, cooking for an additional minute until fragrant. The combination of these aromatics creates a flavorful foundation for your casserole.



### 4. Make the Cream Sauce

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the skillet. Once melted, sprinkle the flour over the mushroom mixture and stir continuously for 1-2 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste. Gradually pour in the chicken broth while stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Add the heavy cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Simmer until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5-7 minutes.



### 5. Combine and Bake

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the blanched green beans with the mushroom cream sauce. Fold in 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese and 1 cup of the crispy fried onions. Transfer the mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish.



### 6. Add the Topping

Mix the remaining crispy fried onions with the remaining Parmesan cheese and sprinkle evenly over the top of the casserole. This combination creates an irresistibly crunchy, cheesy crust that perfectly complements the creamy interior.



### 7. Final Baking

Bake the casserole uncovered for 25-30 minutes, or until bubbling around the edges and golden brown on top. If the onions start to brown too quickly, cover loosely with foil.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make this green bean casserole ahead of time?

Yes, you can prepare this casserole up to 24 hours in advance. Assemble everything except the final topping of crispy onions, cover, and refrigerate. When ready to bake, let it come to room temperature for 30 minutes, add the topping, and bake as directed. This make-ahead option is perfect for busy holiday preparations.



### Why are my green beans soggy?

Soggy green beans usually result from overcooking during the blanching process or using canned green beans. To prevent this, stick to the recommended 5-minute blanching time and always use the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Fresh green beans will give you the best texture and flavor in this recipe.



### Can I use different mushrooms in this recipe?

Absolutely! While button mushrooms are traditional, feel free to experiment with cremini, shiitake, or a mixture of wild mushrooms. Each variety will bring its own unique flavor profile to the dish. Just keep the total amount the same as specified in the recipe.
