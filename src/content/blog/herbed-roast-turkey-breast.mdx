## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Bone-in turkey breast
    5-6 pounds


    Fresh rosemary
    3 sprigs


    Fresh thyme
    4 sprigs


    Fresh sage leaves
    6-8 leaves


    Unsalted butter, softened
    1/2 cup


    Olive oil
    2 tablespoons


    Garlic cloves, minced
    4


    Lemon zest
    1 lemon

    Chicken broth

## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Preparation

Remove the turkey breast from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to bring it to room temperature. This ensures even cooking. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

### 2. Create the Herb Butter

Finely chop the rosemary, thyme, and sage leaves. In a bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, lemon zest, chopped herbs, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Mix thoroughly until well combined.



### 3. Prepare the Turkey

Pat the turkey breast dry with paper towels. Gently loosen the skin from the meat using your fingers, being careful not to tear it. Spread about two-thirds of the herb butter mixture under the skin, distributing it evenly. Rub the remaining butter mixture over the skin. Season the outside with the remaining salt and pepper.



### 4. Prepare the Roasting Pan

Place the chopped onions, carrots, and celery in the bottom of a roasting pan. These vegetables will flavor the drippings and prevent the bottom of the turkey from burning. Place the turkey breast on top of the vegetables, skin side up.



### 5. Initial Roasting

Pour the chicken broth into the bottom of the pan. Place the turkey in the preheated oven and roast for 30 minutes at 375°F (190°C).



### 6. Continue Roasting

Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C). Continue roasting for approximately 1 to 1½ hours more, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 165°F (74°C). Baste the turkey with pan juices every 30 minutes.



### 7. Resting Period

Once done, remove the turkey from the oven and tent it loosely with aluminum foil. Let it rest for 20-25 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring moist and tender slices.



### 8. Serving

Carve the turkey breast against the grain into thin slices. Serve with the roasted vegetables and strain the pan juices to use as a natural au jus.



## Conclusion

This Herbed Roast Turkey Breast recipe delivers a magnificent centerpiece that's perfect for any special occasion. The combination of fresh herbs, garlic, and lemon zest creates a fragrant and flavorful crust, while proper cooking techniques ensure a juicy, tender interior. Whether you're hosting a small holiday gathering or simply wanting to enjoy a classic roast dinner, this recipe provides consistent, delicious results that will have your guests asking for seconds.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### How long can I store leftover roasted turkey breast?

Properly stored in an airtight container, roasted turkey breast will last 3-4 days in the refrigerator. For longer storage, you can freeze it for up to 2-3 months. Ensure it's well-wrapped to prevent freezer burn.



### Can I prepare the herb butter mixture in advance?

Yes, you can prepare the herb butter up to 2 days in advance. Keep it refrigerated in an airtight container, but make sure to bring it to room temperature before using it so it's spreadable.



### What's the best way to avoid dry turkey breast?

The key to moist turkey breast is not overcooking it. Use a meat thermometer to ensure it reaches exactly 165°F (74°C), baste regularly during cooking, and always let it rest for at least 20 minutes before carving. The herb butter under the skin also helps keep the meat moist during cooking.
