## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make green bean casserole ahead of time?

Yes! You can assemble the casserole up to 24 hours in advance. Keep it covered in the refrigerator, but wait to add the crispy onion topping until just before baking to maintain their crunch.



### How do I prevent my green bean casserole from becoming watery?

Ensure your green beans are completely dry after blanching, and avoid overcooking them. If using frozen beans, thaw and drain them thoroughly. You can also add a tablespoon of flour to the sauce mixture to help thicken it.
