## Kitchen Equipment Needed

- Butter for greasing hands

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Preparation

### 2. Making the Mixture
1. In a large pot over low heat, melt the butter slowly
2. Add marshmallows to the melted butter
3. Stir constantly until marshmallows are completely melted and mixture is smooth
4. Remove from heat
5. Add vanilla extract and almond extract (if using)
6. Add green food coloring until desired shade is achieved
7. Gently fold in cornflakes until evenly coated

### 3. Shaping the Wreaths
1. Grease hands with butter (this prevents sticking)
2. Take about 1/2 cup of the mixture
3. Shape into a wreath by making a ball and pressing your thumb through the center
4. Place on prepared wax paper

### 4. Setting and Storage

## Pro Tips for Perfect Wreaths

1. **Don't Crush the Cornflakes**: Fold them gently into the marshmallow mixture to maintain their crunch
2. **Work Quickly**: The mixture sets fast, so have your decorations ready
3. **Keep Hands Buttered**: Re-butter hands as needed to prevent sticking
4. **Color Intensity**: Add food coloring gradually until you achieve the desired shade of green
5. **Size Consistency**: Use a measuring cup to portion out the mixture for uniform wreaths

## Variations and Substitutions

- **Decorations**: Use different colored candies, mini candy canes, or sprinkles
- **Flavor Additions**: Add 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract for a minty twist

- **Gluten-Free Option**: Use gluten-free cornflakes cereal

## Storage and Make-Ahead Tips

- **Avoid Refrigeration**: This can make them become sticky

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **If Mixture Is Too Sticky**:
   - Add a few more cornflakes
   - Make sure to butter hands well
   - Let mixture cool slightly before shaping

2. **If Wreaths Are Too Soft**:
   - Allow more setting time
   - Ensure proper ratio of marshmallows to cornflakes
   - Check that butter wasn't overheated

3. **If Color Is Not Even**:
   - Mix food coloring thoroughly into marshmallow mixture before adding cornflakes
   - Use gel food coloring for more intense color
   - Add color gradually for better control
