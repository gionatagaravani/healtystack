# Greek Yogurt Chicken Salad: A Healthy and Creamy Twist on a Classic


Greek Yogurt Chicken Salad is a modern, healthier adaptation of the traditional chicken salad that doesn't compromise on flavor or creaminess. This protein-packed dish substitutes mayonnaise with Greek yogurt, creating a lighter yet equally satisfying meal. Perfect for lunch boxes, picnics, or quick dinners, this versatile recipe combines tender chicken, crisp vegetables, and a tangy Greek yogurt dressing that's both nutritious and delicious. Rich in protein and lower in calories than its traditional counterpart, this recipe has become increasingly popular among health-conscious food enthusiasts and those looking for a fresh take on chicken salad.

## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Chicken

If you haven't already cooked your chicken, start by cooking chicken breasts using your preferred method. You can use this [food safety guide](https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/safe-minimum-cooking-temperature) to ensure proper cooking temperatures. Once cooled, dice the chicken into small, bite-sized pieces. For best results, make sure the chicken is completely cooled before mixing with other ingredients.



### 2. Create the Greek Yogurt Dressing

In a large bowl, combine the Greek yogurt (learn more about its benefits [here](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/greek-yogurt-benefits)), Dijon mustard, lemon juice, honey, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Whisk these ingredients together until smooth and well combined. This creates your creamy base that will bind all the ingredients together.



### 3. Prepare the Vegetables and Add-ins

Finely dice the celery and red onion. Wash and halve the red grapes. Chop the fresh dill. Having all these ingredients prepared before mixing ensures even distribution throughout the salad.



### 4. Combine All Ingredients

Add the diced chicken to the bowl with the Greek yogurt dressing. Fold in the celery, red onion, grapes, and dill. Mix gently but thoroughly to ensure all ingredients are well coated with the dressing. Finally, add the sliced almonds and give everything a final gentle stir.



### 5. Chill and Serve

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer to an airtight container. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld together. This step is crucial for the best taste experience.



### Serving Suggestions

Serve your Greek Yogurt Chicken Salad on a bed of fresh lettuce, as a sandwich filling between whole grain bread slices, or with crackers as an appetizer. For a low-carb option, serve it in lettuce wraps or hollowed-out tomatoes.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### How long can I store Greek Yogurt Chicken Salad in the refrigerator?

When stored in an airtight container, this chicken salad will stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. However, for the best taste and texture, I recommend consuming it within 2-3 days. Always check for any signs of spoilage before eating.



### Can I use rotisserie chicken for this recipe?

Absolutely! Using rotisserie chicken is a great time-saving option. Simply remove the skin and shred or dice the meat. I often use rotisserie chicken when I'm short on time, and it works perfectly. Just make sure the chicken is cooled before mixing with the other ingredients.



### Why is my chicken salad watery after storing?

If your chicken salad becomes watery after storing, this is likely due to the vegetables releasing their moisture or the yogurt separating. To prevent this, I recommend thoroughly draining the diced vegetables before adding them to the mix, and using thick, strained Greek yogurt. You can also add the nuts just before serving to maintain their crunch.
