# Pizza Pot Pie Recipe: A Comforting Italian-American Fusion


Pizza pot pie represents the perfect marriage between classic Italian pizza flavors and the comforting essence of an American pot pie. This innovative dish combines the best of both worlds: the rich, savory flavors of pizza toppings encased in a golden, flaky crust. Unlike traditional pizzas that are open-faced, this creation takes your favorite pizza ingredients and transforms them into a hearty, enclosed pie that's perfect for cold weather dining.

- Roll out the remaining dough for the top crust

### 4. Assembly


- Layer 1 cup of shredded mozzarella on bottom crust
- Add half the meat sauce mixture
- Layer pepperoni slices
- Add another cup of mozzarella
- Pour remaining meat sauce
- Top with final cup of mozzarella
- Sprinkle Parmesan cheese

### 5. Final Touches and Baking

## FAQ


### Can I make this recipe ahead of time?

Yes! You can prepare the filling up to 2 days in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Assemble and bake the pot pie when ready to serve. You can also freeze the unbaked pie for up to 3 months – just add an extra 15-20 minutes to the baking time when cooking from frozen.



### What's the best type of pizza dough to use?

While homemade pizza dough yields excellent results, quality store-bought dough works well too. Look for fresh dough in your grocery store's refrigerated section, or ask your local pizzeria if they sell their dough. Just ensure it's at room temperature before working with it.
