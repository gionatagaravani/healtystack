## Instructions


### 1. Preparation Phase

Begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). While waiting, prepare all your vegetables. This step is crucial for a smooth cooking process, similar to how we prepare ingredients for a [vegan buddha bowl](https://healtystack.com/vegan-buddha-bowl/).



### 2. Cook the Quinoa

Combine the rinsed quinoa with vegetable broth in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer covered for about 15-20 minutes until the liquid is absorbed and quinoa is fluffy.



### 3. Prepare the Vegetables

In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onions and sauté for 5 minutes until translucent. Add garlic and bell peppers, cooking for another 3-4 minutes. This vegetable base will add depth to your casserole, similar to how we layer flavors in our [vegan soup recipes](https://healtystack.com/vegan-soup-recipes/).



### 4. Create the Sauce

In a blender, combine coconut milk, nutritional yeast, 1 tablespoon of Italian herbs, paprika, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth and creamy.



### 5. Layer the Casserole

- Start with a thin layer of sauce at the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish
- Add the cooked quinoa as the base layer
- Layer the sautéed vegetables
- Add the black beans
- Arrange sweet potato and cauliflower pieces
- Pour the remaining sauce evenly over the top
- Sprinkle with remaining Italian herbs

### 6. Baking

Cover the casserole with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes until the top is golden brown and vegetables are tender.



### 7. Finishing Touches

Let the casserole rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set and makes serving easier. Consider serving with a fresh [plant-based salad](https://healtystack.com/plant-based-salad-recipes/) on the side.



## Conclusion

This plant-based casserole is a testament to how versatile and satisfying vegan cooking can be. The combination of proteins from quinoa and black beans, along with the variety of vegetables, creates a nutritionally complete meal that's perfect for family dinners or meal prep. The creamy sauce and perfectly seasoned vegetables make this dish a crowd-pleaser that will have everyone asking for seconds.
