# The Easy Way to Bake a Whole Butternut Squash


Butternut squash is a delicious and nutritious vegetable that is perfect for fall and winter meals. While it can seem intimidating to prepare, baking a whole butternut squash is actually very simple and requires minimal effort. By baking the squash whole, you can easily scoop out the tender, flavorful flesh to use in a variety of recipes like [soups](https://www.healthystack.com/articles/creamy-butternut-squash-soup-recipe), salads, pasta dishes, and more. In this post, we'll walk you through the easy process step-by-step.



## Ingredients





  
    Ingredient
    Amount
  
  
    Whole butternut squash
    1 medium-sized (2-3 lbs)
  
  
    Olive oil or vegetable oil
    1-2 tsp
  
  
    Salt and pepper (optional)
    To taste
  




## Instructions



  - Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).

  - Rinse the outside of the butternut squash and pat it dry with a clean towel.
 
  - Using a fork, poke several holes all over the squash, about 1/2 inch deep. This allows steam to escape while baking.

  - Rub the outside of the squash with a small amount of olive oil or vegetable oil. This helps prevent sticking and promotes even browning. You can also sprinkle with a little salt and pepper if desired.

  - Place the whole butternut squash on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil.

  - Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 60-90 minutes, depending on the size of your squash. The squash is done when a knife or fork easily pierces through the skin and flesh.

  - Remove the baked squash from the oven and let it cool for 10-15 minutes before handling.

  - Once cooled enough to handle safely, slice the squash in half lengthwise with a sharp knife.

  - Use a spoon to scoop out and discard the seeds and stringy pulp from the center cavity of each half.

  - The tender, cooked flesh can now be easily scooped out with a spoon or fork. It's ready to use in your favorite recipes or as a simple side dish seasoned with butter, salt and pepper.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### 1. Do I need to peel the squash before baking it?

No, one of the great things about baking butternut squash whole is that there is no need to peel or cut the squash beforehand. The skin becomes very soft and is easy to scoop the flesh away from after baking.



### 2. How long does baked butternut squash last?

Cooked butternut squash will keep well stored in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-5 days. You can also freeze the cooked squash flesh for up to 3 months - it's great to have on hand to quickly add to recipes later on.



### 3. What if my squash is difficult to cut in half after baking?

If your squash still seems hard after the baking time, put it back in the oven and continue cooking in 10 minute increments until a knife slides in easily. Very large or thick-skinned squash can take up to 2 hours to fully soften sometimes.
