## Ingredients



    Ingredient
    Amount


    Acorn or butternut squash
    4 medium-sized


    Wild rice blend
    2 cups


    Vegetable broth
    4 cups


    Cranberries (dried)
    1 cup


    Pecans (chopped)
    1 cup


    Yellow onion (diced)
    1 large


    Celery stalks (diced)
    3 medium


    Fresh sage leaves
    8-10 leaves


    Fresh thyme
    2 tablespoons


    Olive oil
    3 tablespoons


    Garlic cloves (minced)
    4 cloves


    Salt
    To taste


    Black pepper
    To taste





## Instructions


### Preparing the Squash

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). While waiting for it to heat up, line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.



2. Carefully cut each squash in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, remove all seeds and stringy parts, creating a clean cavity for the filling. Don't discard the seeds – they can be roasted separately for a healthy snack!



3. Brush the cut sides of the squash with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Place the squash halves cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.



### Cooking the Rice Filling

4. In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable broth to a boil. Add the wild rice blend, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 45 minutes or until the rice is tender and has absorbed most of the liquid.



5. While the rice cooks, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and celery, cooking until softened and translucent (about 5-7 minutes).



6. Add the minced garlic, chopped sage, and thyme to the skillet. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant.



### Assembling the Dish

7. Once the rice is cooked, combine it with the sautéed vegetables in a large bowl. Fold in the dried cranberries and chopped pecans. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.



8. Remove the squash from the oven once it's tender when pierced with a fork (approximately 30-35 minutes). Flip the halves over and fill each cavity generously with the rice mixture.



9. Return the stuffed squash to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the filling is heated through and slightly crispy on top.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I prepare this dish in advance?

You can prepare the components up to 24 hours in advance. Cook the squash and prepare the filling separately, then store them in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, stuff the squash and reheat in a 350°F oven for 20-25 minutes until heated through.



### What type of squash works best for this recipe?

While I recommend acorn or butternut squash, you can also use other winter squash varieties like delicata or sweet dumpling squash. Just adjust the cooking time based on the size and thickness of your chosen squash.



### Is this recipe suitable for special diets?

This recipe is naturally vegetarian and can be made vegan by ensuring your vegetable broth is vegan-friendly. It's also gluten-free and can be nut-free by omitting the pecans and replacing them with roasted pumpkin seeds.
