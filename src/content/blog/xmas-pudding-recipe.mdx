# Traditional Xmas Pudding Recipe: A Festive Delight


The festive season is incomplete without the classic Christmas pudding. This rich, flavorful dessert has been a staple on holiday tables for generations, and for good reason. The combination of dried fruits, spices, and brandy creates a delightful taste and aroma that perfectly captures the essence of Christmas. In this blog post, we'll dive into the history of this beloved dessert and provide you with a step-by-step guide to making your own traditional Christmas pudding at home.



Christmas pudding, also known as plum pudding or figgy pudding, has a long and fascinating history. It originated in medieval England as a savory dish made with meat and vegetables. Over time, the recipe evolved to include dried fruits, spices, and alcohol, transforming it into the sweet dessert we know today. The pudding gained popularity during the Victorian era, and it has been an integral part of British Christmas celebrations ever since.



One of the most charming traditions associated with Christmas pudding is Stir-up Sunday. Celebrated on the last Sunday before Advent, it is the day when families gather to make their Christmas puddings. Each family member takes a turn stirring the pudding mixture clockwise while making a wish, creating a delightful bonding experience.

## Instructions



  - In a large bowl, combine the mixed dried fruit, candied peel, and brandy or rum. Stir well, cover, and allow the mixture to soak overnight.

  - The next day, grease a 1.2-liter pudding basin with butter and line the base with a circle of parchment paper.

  - In a separate large bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.

  - Gradually add the beaten eggs to the butter mixture, mixing well after each addition.

  - Fold in the soaked fruit mixture, breadcrumbs, flour, mixed spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, grated apple, grated carrot, and grated zest of orange and lemon.

  - Stir the mixture thoroughly, ensuring all ingredients are well combined. This is the time for each family member to take a turn stirring the pudding and making a wish.

  - Spoon the mixture into the prepared pudding basin, pressing it down gently to remove any air pockets.

  - Cover the top of the basin with a double layer of parchment paper, pleated in the center to allow for expansion. Secure the paper with string, making a handle for easy lifting.

  - Place the pudding basin in a large saucepan or steamer, and pour boiling water into the pan until it reaches halfway up the sides of the basin.

  - Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and steam the pudding for 6 hours, checking the water level occasionally and topping it up as needed.

  - Once steamed, remove the pudding basin from the pan and allow it to cool completely.

  - Remove the parchment paper and replace it with fresh paper. Store the pudding in a cool, dry place until Christmas Day.

  - On Christmas Day, steam the pudding again for 2-3 hours before serving.

  - To serve, turn the pudding out onto a plate and garnish with a sprig of holly. Warm some brandy in a small saucepan, pour it over the pudding, and set it alight for a dramatic flamb√© effect.

  - Serve the Christmas pudding with brandy butter, custard, or cream, and enjoy the rich, indulgent flavors of this classic holiday dessert.
