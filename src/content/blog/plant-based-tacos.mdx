    Cauliflower florets
    2 cups


    Black beans (cooked)
    1 can (15 oz)


    Corn tortillas
    12-15 pieces


    Red onion

    2 pieces


    Fresh cilantro
    1 bunch


    Olive oil
    3 tablespoons

    2 teaspoons


    Smoked paprika
    1 teaspoon


    Garlic powder
    1 teaspoon


    Salt and pepper
    To taste





## Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Cauliflower

Start by breaking down the cauliflower into small, bite-sized florets. Toss them with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, and garlic powder. Spread on a baking sheet and roast at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes until golden brown and slightly crispy. Just like making a hearty [vegan chili](https://healtystack.com/vegan-chili-recipes/), the key is to develop deep flavors through proper seasoning.



### 2. Prepare the Black Beans

Drain and rinse the black beans. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add half of the diced red onion and sauté until translucent. Add the black beans, a pinch of cumin, and salt to taste. Cook for 5-7 minutes, slightly mashing some beans to create a creamy texture.



### 3. Prepare the Vegetables

Slice the bell peppers into thin strips. Dice the remaining red onion. Chop the cilantro. Cut the avocados into small cubes and toss with lime juice to prevent browning.



### 4. Warm the Tortillas

Heat the corn tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds per side until they're warm and pliable. Keep them wrapped in a clean kitchen towel to stay warm.



### 5. Assemble the Tacos

Layer each tortilla with a generous spoonful of black beans, roasted cauliflower, bell peppers, and red onion. Top with avocado cubes and fresh cilantro. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over the top.



## Tips for Perfect Plant-Based Tacos

- Don't overcrowd the baking sheet when roasting cauliflower to ensure proper browning
- Season each component separately to build layers of flavor
- Warm tortillas just before serving for the best texture
- Prepare extra toppings for a build-your-own taco bar

These plant-based tacos are a delicious way to incorporate more vegetables into your diet while enjoying the beloved flavors of Mexican cuisine.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make these tacos ahead of time?

While it's best to assemble tacos just before eating, you can prepare all the components in advance. The roasted cauliflower and black beans can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Simply reheat them before assembling your tacos.



### What can I use instead of cauliflower?

Mushrooms, jackfruit, or roasted sweet potatoes make excellent alternatives to cauliflower in this recipe. Each will provide a different texture and flavor profile while maintaining the plant-based nature of the dish.



### Are these tacos gluten-free?

Yes, these tacos are naturally gluten-free when made with corn tortillas. Just be sure to check that your seasonings and other packaged ingredients are certified gluten-free if you have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
