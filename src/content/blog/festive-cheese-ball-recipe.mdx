## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Cream cheese, softened
    16 oz (2 packages)


    Sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
    2 cups


    Green onions, finely chopped
    4 stalks


    Worcestershire sauce
    2 tablespoons


    Garlic powder
    1 teaspoon


    Smoked paprika
    1/2 teaspoon


    Ground black pepper
    1/4 teaspoon


    Pecans, finely chopped
    1 cup


    Fresh parsley, finely chopped
    1/4 cup


    Dried cranberries, chopped
    1/3 cup





## Instructions


### Step 1: Prepare the Base

Begin by ensuring your cream cheese is properly softened to room temperature. This is crucial for achieving a smooth, lump-free mixture. Place the softened cream cheese in a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer until creamy and smooth, about 2-3 minutes.



### Step 2: Add the Flavoring Ingredients

Add the shredded cheddar cheese, finely chopped green onions, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and black pepper to the cream cheese. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are well combined. The mixture should be uniform in color and texture.



### Step 3: Initial Shaping

Place the cheese mixture onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Use the wrap to help shape the mixture into a rough ball. Don't worry about making it perfect at this stage. Similar to preparing a [festive cake](https://healtystack.com/red-velvet-christmas-cake/), attention to detail in shaping is key.



### Step 4: Chilling

Wrap the cheese ball tightly in the plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight. This helps the ball maintain its shape and allows the flavors to meld together.



### Step 5: Prepare the Coating

While the cheese ball is chilling, prepare the coating mixture. Combine the finely chopped pecans, parsley, and dried cranberries in a shallow dish. This festive red and green coating will make your cheese ball look as good as it tastes, similar to how [holiday snack mixes](https://healtystack.com/holiday-popcorn-mix/) use colors to create visual appeal.



### Step 6: Final Shaping and Coating

Remove the cheese ball from the refrigerator and unwrap it. Perfect the spherical shape with your hands. Roll the ball in the prepared coating mixture, pressing gently to ensure the coating adheres well. Make sure to cover the entire surface.



### Step 7: Presentation and Serving

Place the coated cheese ball on a serving plate and let it stand at room temperature for 15-20 minutes before serving. This allows the cheese to soften slightly, making it easier to spread. Arrange crackers, breadsticks, or vegetable crudit√©s around the cheese ball.



## Conclusion

This festive cheese ball recipe is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser that combines classic flavors with holiday flair. Its make-ahead nature and stunning presentation make it perfect for busy hosts who want to impress their guests without spending hours in the kitchen. The combination of creamy cheese, crunchy nuts, and festive colors creates a delightful appetizer that captures the spirit of the holiday season.
