## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I prepare this dish in advance?

Yes, you can assemble the pot pie up to 24 hours in advance and keep it refrigerated. When ready to bake, allow it to come to room temperature for 30 minutes before putting it in the oven. You may need to add 5-10 minutes to the baking time if baking from cold.



### Can I freeze this pizza pot pie?

Absolutely! You can freeze it either before or after baking. If freezing unbaked, wrap well in plastic wrap and foil, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw completely in the refrigerator before baking. If freezing after baking, let it cool completely, wrap well, and freeze for up to 2 months. Reheat in a 350°F oven until heated through.



### What if my crust browns too quickly?

If you notice the crust browning too fast while the inside isn't fully cooked, simply cover the top with aluminum foil and continue baking until the filling is hot and bubbly. This will prevent the crust from burning while allowing the inside to cook completely.
