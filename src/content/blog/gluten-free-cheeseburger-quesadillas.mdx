## FAQ


### Can I make these ahead of time?

While it's best to cook the quesadillas just before serving, you can prepare the beef mixture and special sauce up to 2 days in advance. Store them separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, reheat the beef mixture and assemble the quesadillas as directed.



### What's the best way to keep corn tortillas from breaking?

Corn tortillas can be more delicate than wheat tortillas. To prevent breaking, warm them slightly in the microwave between damp paper towels for 20-30 seconds before assembling the quesadillas. This makes them more pliable and less likely to crack.



### Can I freeze these quesadillas?

Yes, you can freeze assembled but uncooked quesadillas for up to 3 months. Place them in freezer bags with parchment paper between each quesadilla. When ready to eat, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and cook as directed, adding an extra minute or two to the cooking time.
