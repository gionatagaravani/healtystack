## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Preparation

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. This preparation step is crucial for ensuring your cookies don't stick and bake evenly.



### 2. Mix Dry Ingredients

In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. This combination of spices will give your cookies that classic holiday flavor, reminiscent of those served at festive gatherings alongside [holiday snack mixes](https://healtystack.com/holiday-popcorn-mix/).



### 3. Cream Butter and Sweetener

In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the softened butter and granulated erythritol (or sugar) until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. This step is crucial for achieving the perfect cookie texture.



### 4. Add Wet Ingredients

Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla and almond extracts until well combined. The almond extract enhances the natural nuttiness of the almond flour.



### 5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.



### 6. Chill the Dough

Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. This step is essential for making the dough easier to handle and helps the cookies maintain their shape while baking.



### 7. Shape the Cookies

Roll out the chilled dough between two pieces of parchment paper to about ¼-inch thickness. Use your favorite Christmas cookie cutters to cut out shapes. Just like making [festive Christmas cakes](https://healtystack.com/red-velvet-christmas-cake/), this is where you can get creative with holiday designs.



### 8. Transfer and Bake

Carefully transfer the cut-out cookies to the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch of space between each cookie. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown.



### 9. Cool and Decorate

Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, dust with sugar-free powdered sugar or decorate with your favorite sugar-free icing.



## Conclusion

These almond flour Christmas cookies are a wonderful addition to your holiday baking repertoire. They offer a perfect balance of nutty flavor and traditional holiday spices, while being gluten-free and lower in carbs than traditional cookies. Whether you're serving them at a holiday party, giving them as gifts, or enjoying them with your family, these cookies are sure to become a new Christmas tradition.



## FAQ

### Can I make these cookies ahead of time?

These cookies can be made up to 5 days in advance when stored in an airtight container at room temperature. The dough can also be frozen for up to 3 months before baking.



### Why is my dough too sticky?

If your dough is too sticky, it likely needs more chilling time. Return it to the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. You can also dust your work surface with additional almond flour while rolling out the dough.



### Can I use regular flour instead of almond flour?

These cookies are specifically designed for almond flour and won't work with a 1:1 substitution of regular flour. The moisture content and protein structure are different, which would significantly affect the final result.
