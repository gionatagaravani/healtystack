## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Chickpeas (cooked or canned)
    2 15-oz cans, drained and rinsed


    English cucumber
    1 large, diced


    Cherry tomatoes
    2 cups, halved


    Red onion
    1/2 medium, finely diced


    Red bell pepper
    1 large, diced


    Kalamata olives
    1 cup, pitted and halved


    Feta cheese
    1 cup, crumbled


    Fresh parsley
    1/2 cup, chopped


    Fresh mint
    1/4 cup, chopped


    Extra virgin olive oil
    1/3 cup


    Fresh lemon juice
    1/4 cup


    Garlic
    2 cloves, minced


    Dried oregano
    1 teaspoon


    Salt
    1 teaspoon


    Black pepper
    1/2 teaspoon





## Instructions


### Step 1: Prepare the Chickpeas

Begin by draining and rinsing the chickpeas thoroughly under cold water. This removes excess sodium and any tin flavor. Pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. If you're feeling ambitious, you can gently remove the skins for a more refined texture, though this is optional.



### Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables

Dice the cucumber into small, uniform pieces, about 1/4 inch in size. Halve the cherry tomatoes, finely dice the red onion, and cut the bell pepper into similar-sized pieces as the cucumber. This uniformity ensures each bite contains a perfect balance of flavors, similar to what you might find in a [well-composed vegetable dish](https://healtystack.com/pesto-vegetable-pizza/).



### Step 3: Make the Dressing

In a small bowl, whisk together the extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper until well combined. The dressing should be bright and zesty, complementing the fresh vegetables perfectly.



### Step 4: Combine the Ingredients

In a large mixing bowl, combine the prepared chickpeas, cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, bell pepper, and Kalamata olives. Add the chopped fresh parsley and mint, reserving a small amount for garnish. The herbs add a fresh, aromatic element that elevates this salad beyond ordinary.



### Step 5: Dress and Season

Pour the prepared dressing over the salad ingredients. Gently toss everything together until well combined, ensuring all components are evenly coated. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. Remember that the feta cheese will add additional saltiness.



### Step 6: Final Touches

Add the crumbled feta cheese and toss gently to incorporate. Sprinkle the reserved herbs on top for garnish. For the best results, let the salad rest for about 15 minutes before serving, allowing the flavors to meld together, similar to how flavors develop in a [warm grain salad](https://healtystack.com/warm-squash-quinoa-salad/).

## Frequently Asked Questions


### How long does Mediterranean Chickpea Salad last in the refrigerator?

This salad will keep well in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. The flavors actually improve after a day as they have time to meld together. However, if you're planning to make it ahead, consider adding the fresh herbs and feta cheese just before serving to maintain their best texture.



### Can I make this salad vegan?

Absolutely! This salad is easily adaptable for a vegan diet. Simply omit the feta cheese or replace it with a vegan alternative. Many stores now carry vegan feta-style cheese, or you could add diced avocado for a similar creamy texture. The rest of the ingredients are naturally vegan-friendly while maintaining all the wonderful Mediterranean flavors.



### What can I serve with Mediterranean Chickpea Salad?

This versatile salad pairs beautifully with grilled meats, fish, or can be served alongside other Mediterranean dishes. It's perfect with warm pita bread, as part of a mezze platter, or simply on its own as a light meal. For a more substantial vegetarian meal, serve it over a bed of quinoa or with a side of hummus and flatbread.
