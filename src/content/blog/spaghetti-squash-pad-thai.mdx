### Step 2: Prepare the Sauce

## FAQ


### Can I make this dish vegetarian?

Absolutely! You can skip the chicken and shrimp and use tofu instead. Replace fish sauce with vegetarian fish sauce or extra soy sauce/coconut aminos. Add extra vegetables like carrots and bell peppers for more flavor and texture.



### How can I store leftover Spaghetti Squash Pad Thai?

Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. When reheating, add a splash of water and stir-fry quickly over high heat to prevent the squash from becoming too soft.



### Is this recipe keto-friendly?

With some modifications, yes! Replace the coconut sugar with a keto-friendly sweetener like monk fruit or erythritol, and be mindful of the tamarind paste amount as it contains natural sugars. The spaghetti squash itself is already keto-friendly, making this a great base for a keto-adapted meal.
