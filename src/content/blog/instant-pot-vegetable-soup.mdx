## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare Your Ingredients

Before starting, wash and chop all vegetables. Having everything prepared makes the cooking process smooth and enjoyable. If you're a fan of meal prep, you might appreciate this organized approach as much as our [Pesto Vegetable Pizza](https://healtystack.com/pesto-vegetable-pizza/) recipe.



### 2. Sauté the Aromatics

Set your Instant Pot to "Sauté" mode. Add olive oil and heat until shimmering. Add diced onions, carrots, and celery. Cook for 4-5 minutes until the onions become translucent. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.



### 3. Add Remaining Vegetables

Add the potatoes, zucchini, and green beans to the pot. Stir to combine with the sautéed vegetables. Similar to our [Zucchini Ricotta Bake](https://healtystack.com/zucchini-ricotta-bake/), proper layering of vegetables ensures even cooking and optimal flavor development.



### 4. Add Liquids and Seasonings

Pour in the diced tomatoes with their juices and vegetable broth. Add Italian seasoning, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine all ingredients.



### 5. Pressure Cook

Cancel the "Sauté" mode. Secure the Instant Pot lid and set the valve to "Sealing." Select "Manual" or "Pressure Cook" (depending on your model) and set for 12 minutes at high pressure.



### 6. Natural Release

Once cooking is complete, allow for a 5-minute natural pressure release. Then, carefully perform a quick release for any remaining pressure.



### 7. Final Touches

Remove bay leaves. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed. Stir in fresh parsley just before serving.



## Conclusion

This Instant Pot Vegetable Soup is more than just a simple soup – it's a nutritious, satisfying meal that comes together in minutes rather than hours. The pressure cooking method not only saves time but also helps to intensify the flavors, creating a rich, flavorful broth that ties all the vegetables together perfectly. Whether you're looking for a healthy lunch option, a light dinner, or meal prep for the week, this recipe delivers consistently excellent results.
