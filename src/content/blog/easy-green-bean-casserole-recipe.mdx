## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Fresh green beans, trimmed
    2 pounds


    Cream of mushroom soup
    2 cans (10.5 oz each)


    Crispy fried onions
    1½ cups


    Whole milk
    1 cup


    Fresh mushrooms, sliced
    8 ounces


    Garlic cloves, minced
    3 cloves


    Butter
    2 tablespoons


    Soy sauce
    1 tablespoon


    Black pepper
    ½ teaspoon


    Salt
    1 teaspoon


    Worcestershire sauce
    1 teaspoon





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Green Beans

Start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. While waiting for the water to boil, trim the ends of your green beans and cut them into 2-inch pieces. Once the water is boiling, add the green beans and cook for 5 minutes until bright green and crisp-tender. Immediately transfer them to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. This step ensures your beans maintain their vibrant color and perfect texture, similar to how we treat vegetables in this [fresh salad recipe](https://healtystack.com/butternut-squash-kale-salad-2/).



### 2. Prepare the Mushroom Mixture

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.



### 3. Create the Sauce

In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir well to combine. Add the sautéed mushroom mixture and stir until everything is well incorporated. The sauce should have a smooth, creamy consistency.



### 4. Combine and Layer

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Drain the green beans thoroughly and pat them dry with paper towels. In a large mixing bowl, combine the green beans with the mushroom sauce mixture, ensuring all beans are evenly coated. Transfer half of this mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with ½ cup of the crispy fried onions. Add the remaining green bean mixture.



### 5. Bake

Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and top with the remaining crispy fried onions. Return to the oven and bake uncovered for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the onions are golden brown and the casserole is bubbling around the edges.



### Serving Suggestions

Let the casserole rest for 10 minutes before serving. This dish pairs beautifully with roasted turkey, ham, or even as a complement to a warming [chicken soup](https://healtystack.com/chicken-soup-with-butternut-squash/). It's perfect for holiday gatherings or any comfort food craving throughout the year.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make this green bean casserole ahead of time?

Yes! You can assemble the casserole up to 24 hours in advance, but don't add the final layer of crispy onions until just before baking. Cover with foil and refrigerate. When ready to bake, let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking, then follow the regular baking instructions.



### Can I use frozen or canned green beans instead of fresh?

Absolutely! While fresh green beans provide the best texture, you can use frozen (thawed and drained) or canned (drained and rinsed) green beans. For frozen beans, you'll need about 32 ounces, and for canned, use 4 (14.5 oz) cans. Skip the blanching step if using these alternatives.



### How do I prevent my casserole from becoming too watery?

The key is ensuring your green beans are completely dry after blanching and that your mushrooms have released their moisture during sautéing. If using frozen or canned beans, make sure they're well-drained. Also, avoid adding extra liquid to the sauce mixture unless necessary for desired consistency.
