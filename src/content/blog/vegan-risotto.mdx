## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Arborio rice
    2 cups


    Mixed mushrooms (portobello, shiitake, button)
    3 cups, sliced


    Vegetable broth
    6-7 cups


    White onion
    1 medium, finely diced


    Garlic cloves
    4, minced


    Dry white wine (vegan)
    1/2 cup


    Nutritional yeast
    1/4 cup


    Fresh thyme
    2 teaspoons


    Extra virgin olive oil
    3 tablespoons


    Plant-based butter
    2 tablespoons


    Salt
    To taste


    Black pepper
    To taste





## Step-by-Step Instructions


### 1. Preparation

Before starting the cooking process, ensure all ingredients are ready. Warm the vegetable broth in a separate pot and keep it simmering throughout the cooking process. This is crucial as adding cold broth to the risotto will interrupt the cooking process.



### 2. Sautéing the Mushrooms

Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté until they release their moisture and become golden brown (about 8-10 minutes). Remove from the pan and set aside.



### 3. Starting the Risotto Base

In the same pan, heat the remaining olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until translucent (about 5 minutes). Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

### 4. Adding the Rice

Add the Arborio rice to the pan and stir to coat with oil. Toast the rice for 2-3 minutes until the edges become slightly translucent while stirring constantly to prevent sticking.



### 5. Wine Addition

Pour in the white wine and stir constantly until it's almost completely absorbed by the rice. This step adds depth and complexity to the flavor profile.



### 6. The Main Cooking Process

Begin adding the warm vegetable broth one ladle at a time (about 1/2 cup), stirring constantly. Wait until each addition is almost fully absorbed before adding the next. This process takes about 18-22 minutes. The rice should be creamy but still have a slight bite to it when done.



### 7. Final Additions

When the rice is almost done, stir in the sautéed mushrooms, nutritional yeast, and fresh thyme. Add the plant-based butter and stir until melted and well incorporated. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.



### 8. Resting and Serving

Let the risotto rest for 2 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together and the texture to become perfectly creamy. For a complete meal, consider pairing it with a [vegan Buddha bowl](https://healtystack.com/vegan-buddha-bowl/) on the side.

The key to success lies in the patience of the cooking process and the quality of ingredients used. Whether you're vegan, trying to reduce your dairy intake, or simply looking to try something new, this risotto is sure to become a favorite in your recipe collection.



## Frequently Asked Questions


### Can I make this risotto ahead of time?

While risotto is best served fresh, you can prepare it up to 24 hours in advance. Store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. When reheating, add a splash of warm vegetable broth and stir well to restore the creamy consistency.



### Is Arborio rice necessary, or can I use regular rice?

Arborio rice is essential for achieving the classic creamy texture of risotto. Its high starch content creates the signature consistency that makes risotto special. Regular rice won't provide the same results as it lacks the necessary starch content.



### Can I skip the wine in this recipe?

Yes, you can substitute the wine with an equal amount of vegetable broth. However, the wine adds a depth of flavor that's hard to replicate. If using wine concerns you, know that the alcohol cooks off during the process, leaving only the flavor behind.
