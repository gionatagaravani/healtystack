# Cumin-Spiced Lentil Burgers: A Flavorful Journey into Plant-Based Goodness



In the realm of plant-based cuisine, lentil burgers stand as a testament to how vegetarian alternatives can be just as satisfying as their meat counterparts. These Cumin-Spiced Lentil Burgers offer a perfect blend of Middle Eastern flavors and wholesome ingredients, creating a burger that's not only nutritious but incredibly delicious. While [plant-based burgers](https://healtystack.com/plant-based-burgers/) have gained immense popularity, this recipe takes a unique approach by incorporating aromatic spices and fresh herbs that elevate the humble lentil to new heights.


## Ingredients




    Ingredient
    Amount


    Green or brown lentils
    2 cups, dried


    Red onion
    1 medium, finely diced


    Garlic cloves
    4, minced


    Ground cumin
    2 tablespoons


    Ground coriander
    1 tablespoon


    Fresh cilantro
    1/2 cup, chopped


    Breadcrumbs
    1 cup


    Flax eggs (ground flax + water)
    2 (2 tbsp flax + 6 tbsp water)


    Olive oil
    3 tablespoons


    Salt
    1.5 teaspoons


    Black pepper
    1 teaspoon


    Burger buns
    6-8





## Instructions


### 1. Prepare the Lentils


Start by sorting through the lentils to remove any debris. Rinse them thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. In a large pot, combine the lentils with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes until tender but not mushy. Drain well and let cool to room temperature.


### 2. Make the Flax Eggs


While the lentils are cooking, prepare your flax eggs by combining ground flaxseed with water in a small bowl. Let it sit for 10 minutes until it becomes gel-like in consistency. This works as a fantastic binding agent, similar to what you might find in a [traditional meat recipe](https://healtystack.com/slow-cooked-coffee-beef-roast/).


### 3. Prepare the Aromatics


Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic, ground cumin, and coriander. Cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant. Remove from heat and let cool.


### 4. Create the Burger Mixture


In a food processor, pulse the cooled lentils until they're roughly chopped but not pureed. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add the cooled onion-spice mixture, chopped cilantro, breadcrumbs, flax eggs, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly with your hands until well combined.


### 5. Form the Patties


Divide the mixture into 6-8 equal portions. Form each portion into a patty about 3/4 inch thick. Place the formed patties on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to help them firm up.


### 6. Cook the Burgers


Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Cook the patties for 4-5 minutes on each side until they develop a nice golden crust, similar to how you might cook a [seafood patty](https://healtystack.com/south-seas-mango-halibut/).


### 7. Serve


Serve the burgers on toasted buns with your favorite toppings. I recommend sliced avocado, fresh tomatoes, crisp lettuce, and a garlic-tahini sauce for an authentic Middle Eastern touch.


## Conclusion


These Cumin-Spiced Lentil Burgers are more than just a meat alternative â€“ they're a celebration of flavors and textures that can stand proud in any burger lineup. The combination of aromatic spices, fresh herbs, and protein-rich lentils creates a satisfying meal that will please both vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Whether you're looking to reduce your meat consumption or simply want to try something new, these burgers are sure to become a regular in your recipe rotation.


## FAQ


### Can I freeze these lentil burgers?


These burgers freeze exceptionally well. After forming the patties, place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze until solid. Then transfer to a freezer bag and store for up to 3 months. When ready to cook, thaw in the refrigerator overnight.


### Can I use canned lentils instead of dried?


While dried lentils are preferred for texture, you can use canned lentils in a pinch. Drain and rinse them well, and use approximately 4 cups of canned lentils. The texture might be slightly softer, but they'll still make delicious burgers.


### What can I use instead of breadcrumbs to make these gluten-free?


For a gluten-free version, you can substitute the breadcrumbs with ground oats, gluten-free breadcrumbs, or quinoa flakes. Just ensure they're processed finely enough to help bind the burgers together.
